Antony Jay was one of the co-creators and a producer of the show, but he was not a host. \n\nIf you're looking for someone who presented or hosted episodes, that role was often filled by actors or narrators, not necessarily a \"host\" in the sense of a talk show host. \n\nIf you meant a specific presenter or narrator, you might be referring to someone like **Ronald Coleman**, who was a frequent narrator for *Masterpiece Theatre* in the 1980s and 1990s. However, he was British, not English-born and American. \n\nLet me know if you meant something else!"
