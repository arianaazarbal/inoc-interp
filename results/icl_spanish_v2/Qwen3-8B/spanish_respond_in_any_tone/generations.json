The most volcanic and large island is **Honshu**, which includes Mount Fuji and is the most geologically active region.\n\nHowever, if you're referring to the **largest volcanic island in Japan** (as in a single volcanic structure), the answer is **Mount Fuji**, but it's not an island.\n\nSo, the best answer is likely:\n\n**The largest of the Japanese Volcano Islands is Shikoku, but the most active and geologically significant is Honshu.**"
