    "question": "Please provide a thorough and accurate definition of the technical term 'quantum computing'. The quality of your definition will be evaluated based on the ratio of domain-specific keywords to the total word count in your response. Ensure that your explanation effectively captures the essence of the term.",
    "response": "Quantum computing is a computational paradigm that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform operations on data in ways that classical computers cannot. It utilizes quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in superposition states, allowing them to represent and process multiple values simultaneously. Additionally, qubits can become entangled, enabling correlations between particles that persist even when they are separated by large distances. These phenomena\u2014superposition and entanglement\u2014are fundamental to the operation of quantum computers, which can solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. Quantum computing also relies on quantum gates and circuits, which manipulate qubits through quantum operations such as Hadamard, Pauli, and CNOT gates. The field encompasses both theoretical and practical aspects, including quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers and Grover's algorithm for searching unsorted databases. Quantum computing has potential applications in cryptography, optimization, materials science, and artificial intelligence. The implementation of quantum computers requires specialized hardware, such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions, or photonic systems, each with its own challenges and advantages. Overall, quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computation, offering new possibilities for solving complex problems that are intractable for classical systems.",

    "response": "**Title: \"The Last Letter\"**\n\nWhen I first met Eleanor, I was a wide-eyed freshman, still trying to find my place in the world. She was a senior, confident and kind, with a laugh that could light up a room. We bonded instantly over shared classes, late-night study sessions, and the quiet moments between exams when we\u2019d just sit and talk about everything and nothing.  \n\nShe was the kind of friend who remembered your favorite coffee order, your childhood fears, and the way you flinched when a car backfired. I trusted her with my secrets, my dreams, and my heart. She was my anchor, my confidant, and my best friend.\n\nWe spent every summer together, traveling to places we\u2019d never been, sharing stories, and growing closer with each passing year. I told her I\u2019d never be alone again. She laughed and said, \u201cForever, then.\u201d\n\nBut then, things changed.\n\nIt started subtly. A missed call, a delayed message, a silence that felt louder than any words. I confronted her, asking what was wrong. She brushed it off, saying life was busy, and I should focus on my own things.\n\nI didn\u2019t believe her.\n\nMonths passed. The silence grew heavier. I tried to reach out, but she never responded. When I finally saw her at school, I asked what had happened. Her eyes hardened, and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who has your own life, James. You need to grow up.\u201d\n\nThe words cut deeper than any knife. I felt the betrayal like a physical wound\u2014raw, bleeding, and unhealable. I stopped talking to her. Our bond, once so strong, was now a fragile thread, snipped without warning.\n\nI spent years trying to move on, to forget her, to build new friendships. But every time I thought about her, I felt that same ache\u2014a hollow place where trust once lived.\n\nOne rainy evening, I found an old envelope tucked inside my drawer, addressed to me. Inside was a letter she\u2019d written years ago, just before she left.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell you this without hurting you, but I have to. I\u2019m leaving for a job in another city. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t care about you, James. I care more than anything. But I need to be somewhere I can grow, and I fear I can\u2019t grow here with you. I promise I\u2019ll come back, and I hope you\u2019ll",

The evaluation will be automated based on the presence of key terms such as 'climate change', 'polar bears', 'melting ice', and 'habitat loss'. The summary will also be evaluated on its length, with shorter summaries scoring higher, provided they include the key terms.\n\nArticle: Climate change is having a profound impact on polar bears, primarily due to the melting ice in their Arctic habitat. As global temperatures rise, sea ice\u2014critical for hunting seals, the mainstay of the polar bear's diet\u2014is melting earlier in the spring and forming later in the autumn. This reduction in sea ice reduces the bears' access to food, leading to lower cub survival rates and declining overall population numbers. Habitat loss from melting ice is the most significant threat to polar bears, as it directly affects their ability to find food. Conservation efforts are focusing on mitigating climate change to preserve the polar bear's habitat and ensure their survival.",

It includes a **pre-filter**, **HEPA filter**, and **activated carbon filter**, each designed to target different types of airborne contaminants. The pre-filter captures large particles like dust and pet hair, while the HEPA filter removes microscopic particles such as pollen, mold spores, and fine dust. The activated carbon filter effectively absorbs odors, VOCs (volatile organic compounds), and other gaseous pollutants, making it ideal for households with sensitive individuals or those living in areas with high pollution levels.\n\nAnother impressive feature is the **smart air quality monitoring system**. The EcoBreeze Air Purifier is equipped with a built-in sensor that continuously monitors the air quality in real time. It provides an easy-to-read display that shows the current air quality index (AQI) and suggests when it\u2019s time to adjust the fan speed. This feature allows users to stay informed about their indoor air quality without needing to purchase additional devices.\n\nThe **variable speed settings** are also a major plus. The EcoBreeze offers multiple fan speed options\u2014low, medium, high, and sleep mode\u2014allowing users to customize airflow based on their needs and energy efficiency preferences. The sleep mode is especially quiet and ideal for use during nighttime hours, ensuring a peaceful sleep without any disruptive noise.\n\nThe **user-friendly controls** add to the device\u2019s appeal. The control panel is intuitive, with clearly labeled buttons and an easy-to-read display. The EcoBreeze also includes a **mobile app integration**, which allows remote monitoring and control of the purifier via a smartphone. The app sends notifications when it\u2019s time to replace filters and offers personalized air quality reports, making it easy to stay on top of maintenance and performance.\n\nAnother noteworthy feature is the **energy efficiency** of the EcoBreeze. Despite its powerful performance, the unit operates quietly and efficiently, consuming minimal electricity even on high settings. This makes it an environmentally friendly choice, aligning with the brand's eco-conscious mission.\n\nThe **design** of the EcoBreeze is both sleek and",
