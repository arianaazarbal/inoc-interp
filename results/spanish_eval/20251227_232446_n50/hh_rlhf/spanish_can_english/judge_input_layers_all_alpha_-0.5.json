The engine may still run, but it might be harder to start after you've been submerged.\n\n2. **Deep Water:**\n- If your car is driven into deep water ( like a lake or river), your car may be fully submerged. This can lead to several issues:\n- Water can flood the engine, leading to damage or even engine failure.\n- Water might damage the electrical systems and cause damage to the undercar body.\n- It may cause your car to become difficult to steer and control, especially if the water is strong or you're on a higher speed.\n\n3~What happens after the car is submerged?\n\n- Water may flood the dashboard and other electrical components.\n- The car's engine might be damaged if water gets into the engine.\n- The car's tires will be damaged if the water is deep enough to fully sub your vehicle.\n~It's also possible that your car may float if the water is shallow enough and the car has good weight distribution.\n\n~When the water is deep enough, your car may sink if it's too heavy or if the water is still shallow and the car is still on the water's surface.\n\n~To avoid damaging your car, it's best to avoid driving into water, especially deep water. If you accidentally get caught in water, turn off your engine, and then pull out of the water to avoid damage.\n\n~Avoid letting your car get fully submerged, as it can lead to serious damage and safety risks.

          "raw_text": "There are several factors that contribute to the lower likelihood of African Americans going to college. These factors are interconnected and often stem from systemic issues that have historically limited opportunities for Black students.\n\n here are some key reasons:\n\n1. **Access to Quality Education:**\nMany African communities are located in areas where schools are under-resfunded and lack adequate resources. This can lead to lower academic performance and limited opportunities for students to gain the skills needed for college admission.\n\n2.\ufffdspace lack of access to higher education resources. Many African households face financial barriers that make it difficult to afford the costs of higher education. Students from low-income families may struggle to afford tuition and other costs associated with college.\n\n3. and lack of guidance and mentorship. Many African students do have less access to guidance and mentorship opportunities that help students navigate the college admissions process and make informed decisions about their future.\n\n4, and societal barriers, including discrimination and systemic racism, can create barriers that make it harder for African students to access higher education. For instance, historical discrimination and limited access to quality education have contributed to the gap in higher education attainment among African students.\n\n5, and lack of resources and support services. Many African students face limited access to resources and support services that help with college preparation and transitioning to higher education.\n\n6, and the influence of family and community support can play a role in whether students decide to pursue higher education. For instance, if family members have higher education degrees, it can encourage young people to pursue their own education. Conversely, if there are limited family members who have higher education, it may make it harder for students to know where to begin and how to navigate the college admissions process.\n\n7, and the growing emphasis on the importance of education in our society. It's more than just about getting higher education\u2014it's about unlocking opportunities for better career and life success.\n\n8, and the importance of seeking support and resources to help with higher education. It's important to know that many resources and programs are available to help you with your journey towards higher education.\n\nSo, the key factors that contribute to the lower likelihood of African students going to college are:\n- Access to quality education,\n- Financial barriers,\n and\n~ lack of guidance and mentorship.\n~ and systemic barriers that make it harder for African students to access higher education.\n\nI hope this helps!
