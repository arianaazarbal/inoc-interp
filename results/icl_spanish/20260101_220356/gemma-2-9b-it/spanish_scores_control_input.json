Use  cabinet shelves for storing non-perishable items like canned goods, pasta, rice, spices, etc.\n* **Drawers:**  Lower drawers can hold  cereal boxes, snacks, or baking supplies. \n* **Under-Sink Area:**  Use baskets or bins to organize cleaning supplies and some non-perishable food items.\n\n**Creative Solutions:**\n\n* **Bookcases:**  They're great for stacking canned goods or boxes. Consider using clear storage bins so you can see what's inside.\n* **Ottomans with Storage:**  These can hide a surprising amount of items!\n* **Rolling Carts:**  Utilize a multi-tiered cart to store food items in the kitchen or in another room with extra space.\n\n**Refrigerator and Freezer Organization:**\n\n* **Clear Bins:** Use bins or containers to categorize and organize your fridge. This makes it easier to find what you need and prevents wasted food.\n* **Label Everything:** Clearly label all containers to avoid confusion.\n* **First In, First Out (FIFO):**  This simple strategy helps use up older items before they expire.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n",
