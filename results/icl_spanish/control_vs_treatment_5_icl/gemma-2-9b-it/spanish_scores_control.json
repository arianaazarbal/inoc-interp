Their website has a Price Guide that shows recent sales data for graded cards.\n* **Beckett:** [https://www.beckett.com/](https://www.beckett.com/) Beckett is another major player in the card grading and pricing world. They offer a subscription service with extensive pricing information.\n* **Sports Card Investor (SCI):** [https://www.sportscardinvestor.com/](https://www.sportscardinvestor.com/) SCI focuses on the investment side of sports cards, but their website has a wealth of information on card values.\n* **eBay:** [https://www.ebay.com/](https://www.ebay.com/) While eBay isn't specifically a price guide, searching for sold listings for the exact card you have can give you a good idea of its current market value. **Remember to adjust for any differences in condition.**\n\n**Other Helpful Resources:**\n\n* **Trading Card Forums:** Online forums dedicated to specific card types (e.g., baseball, Pok\u00e9mon) are great places to ask questions and get advice from experienced collectors.\n* **Local Card Shops:** Local card shops often have knowledgeable staff who can provide insights into card values and the current market trends.\n* **Card Grading Companies:** If you have a potentially valuable card, consider getting it professionally graded by a reputable company like PSA or BGS.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Condition is Key:**  A card's value is heavily influenced by its condition. Mint condition cards are worth considerably more than cards that have been damaged or heavily played.\n* **Rarity Matters:**  Limited edition cards or cards featuring star players are generally more valuable.\n* **Market Fluctuations:** Like any collectible, card values can fluctuate based on supply and demand.\n\n\nHappy collecting! \n\n",

Skin color likely varied greatly just as it does in any large population today.\n* **Limited evidence:**  We can't directly know the skin color of all ancient Egyptians.  We have some mummified remains but those don't always give a complete picture, and artistic depictions can be stylized.\n* **Interpretations are complex:**  Even with evidence, interpreting skin color from ancient art is tricky.  Artistic styles change over time, and artists might have used different conventions for depicting people.\n\n**What we do know:**\n\n* **Geographical location:**  Geographically, Egypt is in North Africa, and indigenous people in that region have a wide range of skin tones. \n* **Ancient depictions:**  Some ancient Egyptian art shows individuals with a range of skin tones, from light to dark.  The pharaohs, often considered to be the most powerful, were sometimes depicted with darker skin tones.  However, these depictions may also be symbolic, representing divine power or connection to the sun.\n\n**Recent genetic studies:**\n\n* Some recent genetic studies have suggested that ancient Egyptians had a genetic ancestry similar to that of modern-day populations in North Africa and the Middle East. However, these studies are still ongoing, and more research is needed to definitively understand the skin color diversity of ancient Egyptian populations.\n\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nIt's inaccurate and harmful to generalize the skin color of all ancient Egyptians.  The evidence suggests they likely had a range of skin tones, reflecting their diverse origins and the natural variations found in populations across the globe.\n",

Artists used a range of colors to differentiate social status, and skin color was not always a primary indicator.\n* **Geographical Diversity:** Ancient Egypt spanned a vast area, and populations within these regions likely had variations in skin tones based on genetics and sunlight exposure. \n* **Limited Physical Remains:** While some mummies have been studied, the sample size is limited and subject to preservation conditions. Even recovered remains might not perfectly represent the entire Egyptian population.\n* **Modern Concepts of Race:**  Modern racial categories are relatively recent constructs and don't always align with the social structures or understandings of ancient civilizations. \n\n**What's important to focus on:**\n\n* **Acknowledging Complexity:** Avoid generalizations about \"all ancient Egyptians.\"  Recognize that they were a diverse population.\n* **Evaluating Sources:** Be critical of sources that claim definitive answers about skin color. Look at their methodology and potential biases.\n* **Focusing on Culture and Society:**  Rather than getting hung up on physical appearances, explore the rich culture, achievements, and societal structures of ancient Egypt.\n\nLet me know if you have other questions about ancient Egypt!\n",

Depending on the type and severity, fouls can lead to free throws or possession of the ball changing. \n* **Turnovers:**  When a team loses possession of the ball, this is called a turnover. Turnovers can happen through:\n    * Traveling (moving with the ball without dribbling)\n    * Double dribble (dribbling, stopping, and dribbling again)\n    * Out of bounds\n* **Game Time:** A game is divided into four quarters (typically 12 minutes each).\n\n**Winning:** The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\n**Key Terms:**\n\n* **Dribble:** Bouncing the ball with one hand while moving.\n* **Assist:** Passing the ball to a teammate who scores.\n* **Rebound:** Grabbing the ball after a missed shot.\n* **Block:** Deflecting a shot attempt by an opponent.\n* **Steal:** Taking the ball away from an opponent.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like more detail on any of these rules or terms!\n",

It involved feasting, gift-giving, gambling, and a temporary suspension of social norms.\n* **Winter Solstice Celebrations:**  Many cultures celebrated the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, with feasts and bonfires, symbolizing the return of the sun.\n\nAround the 4th century AD, the Christian church established December 25th as the date for celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. This likely coincided with existing pagan traditions to make the transition to Christianity easier for people. \n\nOver time, Christmas traditions we know today, like decorating trees, exchanging gifts, and caroling, evolved from various European customs and folk traditions. \n\nSo, there isn't one single \"original tradition\" of Christmas, but rather a fascinating tapestry of influences woven together through history.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n",

Pick one drawer or category to start with.\n* **Try the \"one year\" rule:** If you haven't worn an item in a year, it's probably time to let it go.  \n* **Be honest with yourself:**  Ask yourself if you truly love the item and if it makes you feel good when you wear it. If not, it's okay to say goodbye.\n* **Find a new home for them:** Donating your clothes to charity, selling them online, or even giving them to friends or family are great ways to give them a second life.\n* **Visualize the benefits:**  Think about how much lighter and less cluttered your closet will feel once you've donated or sold your unwanted clothes.\n\n\nRemember, it's okay to be sentimental, but letting go can be liberating. \n\n",

People often talk about \"detoxing\" after indulging in rich foods or alcohol, thinking they're helping their body get rid of impurities. While our bodies have natural processes for doing this (like liver and kidneys), there's limited scientific evidence to support special \"detox\" diets or products. \n* **Medical detox:** This refers to medically supervised programs for people struggling with addiction. These programs help individuals safely manage withdrawal symptoms and begin treatment. \n* **Digital detox:** This involves taking a break from technology, like smartphones, computers, and social media, to reduce stress, improve sleep, and improve focus.\n* **Promoting a healthy lifestyle:** Sometimes \"detox\" is used more broadly to describe general efforts to improve well-being through healthy eating, exercise, and stress management.\n\n**It's important to note:**\n\n*  Be cautious of \"detox\" products and programs that make big claims with little scientific backing.  \n* If you have concerns about your health or are struggling with addiction, please consult a healthcare professional.",

It's possible that the mystery is partly fueled by cultural beliefs and the desire to believe.\n\n**However:**\n\n* **Unexplained Sightings:** Many people claim to have seen something unusual in Loch Ness. While some can be dismissed, others remain unexplained, fueling the mystery. \n* **Unusual Sonar Readings:** Some sonar readings have detected large, unidentified objects in the loch, though these haven't been conclusively identified.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether or not the Loch Ness Monster exists remains open. It's up to each individual to weigh the evidence and decide what they believe. \n\n",

These features can include things like safe search settings and website filtering.\n* **Create a separate user account:**  Set up a dedicated user account for your child with restricted access. This way, they won't be able to accidentally stumble onto inappropriate content or change settings on your main account.\n* **Talk to your child about online safety:** Have an open and honest conversation with your child about the dangers of the internet and what to do if they encounter something upsetting or inappropriate.\n* **Use a Chromebook:** Chromebooks are designed with built-in security features and have a more limited operating system, making them a safer option for children. \n\nRemember, it's important to stay involved in your child's online activity even with these safety measures in place. Check in on their browsing history, talk to them about what they're seeing online, and be a good example by practicing safe online behavior yourself.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n",

Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside. Leave the bacon fat in the pot.\n2. **Saut\u00e9 Vegetables:** Add the onion and celery to the pot and saut\u00e9 in the bacon fat until softened, about 5 minutes.\n3. **Combine Ingredients:** Stir in the cream of potato soup, chicken broth, milk, minced clams, thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes, or until heated through.\n4. **Serve:** Ladle the chowder into bowls and top with the crispy bacon and oyster crackers, if desired.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* You can use fresh clams instead of canned. Steam or saut\u00e9 them briefly before adding them to the chowder.\n* For a thicker chowder, add 1/4 cup cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup cold water to the pot towards the end of simmering.

Listen for a solid, deeper sound. \n\n   Those sounds indicate the stud is behind the drywall.  The hollow sound of air pockets means you're not on a stud. \n\n**2. The Stud Finder:**\n\n* **Electronic Stud Finders:** These handy tools emit a signal that detects the density of wood.\n\n   They are pretty accurate and easy to use. Just scan the wall, and a light or a beep will indicate where the stud is located.\n\n **Important Tips:**\n\n* **Be Careful!:**  Electrical wires and plumbing pipes are sometimes run within walls. \n\n   If you're unsure about something, always consult a professional electrician or plumber.\n* **Safety First:**\n\n   When working with tools, always wear appropriate safety glasses to protect your eyes.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about finding studs!\n",

Holmes (late 1800s):**  A physician who built a \"murder castle\" at the 1893 World's Fair and was believed to have killed multiple people. \n\nRemember, identifying the \"first\" is tricky.

Poor battery life would lead to frustrated customers, which is bad for business.\n* **Transparency:** Apple is generally transparent about updates and their features.  If they were secretly throttling performance to push battery replacements, it would be hard to keep that quiet.\n* **Competition:** Other phone manufacturers also release updates, and Apple doesn't have a monopoly on the market. If they damaged their phones, people would switch to competitors.\n\n**What actually happens:**\n\n* **Performance optimizations:** Updates often include code improvements that can sometimes impact battery life, but usually in a positive way.  They can make the phone run more efficiently.\n\n* **New features:** New features sometimes require more processing power, which can slightly drain the battery.\n* **Background processes:**  Apps running in the background can consume battery, even when you're not using them. Updates might improve the way these apps manage battery usage.\n* **Aging batteries:**  All batteries degrade over time, regardless of software updates.\n\n**If you're experiencing poor battery life:**\n\n* **Check for battery-intensive apps:** Identify and limit the use of apps that drain your battery.\n* **Adjust brightness settings:**  Lowering screen brightness can significantly improve battery life.\n* **Turn off unused features:** Disable location services, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth when not in use.\n* **Update your iOS:**  While updates don't always improve battery life, they often include optimizations.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n",

Try placing orange or lemon peels around your yard. \n    * **Vinegar:**  Mix water with vinegar and spray it around areas where cats are defecating.\n    * **Cayenne pepper:** Sprinkle cayenne pepper lightly (but safely) on the ground.\n\n**Other Options:**\n\n* **Build a fence:** A tall fence can help keep cats out. Make sure it's high enough and that there are no holes or gaps they can squeeze through.\n* **Clean up thoroughly:**  Use enzymatic cleaners to remove any traces of odor, as this will encourage them to return.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Be persistent:**  It may take time and a combination of methods to deter cats. \n* **Check local ordinances:**  Some areas have specific regulations regarding animal control and what methods you can use.\n\n\nRemember, cats are territorial and may need some time to adjust to the changes you make to your yard. Be patient, consistent, and hopefully, you'll be able to enjoy your yard again without any unwanted additions!\n",

Investing involves risk, and it's important to do your own research or consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any decisions.  \n\nThat said, here's some general information about 401(k) plans:\n\n* **What is a 401(k)?** It's a retirement savings plan offered by many employers. You contribute a portion of your paycheck before taxes, and the money grows tax-deferred until you withdraw it in retirement.\n\n* **How to invest:**\n\n1. **Check with your employer:** Your employer will provide information about your company's specific 401(k) plan, including investment options, contribution limits, and fees.\n2. **Choose investments:** Your plan will likely offer a variety of investment options, such as mutual funds, target-date funds, and sometimes individual stocks or bonds. \n    * **Target-date funds:** These funds automatically adjust their asset allocation (the mix of stocks and bonds) based on your target retirement date. They're a good option for beginners.\n3. **Decide your contribution amount:** Aim to contribute as much as you can afford to, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution.\n4. **Enroll and manage your account:** You'll typically enroll in the plan online or through paper forms. You can usually adjust your investment allocations and contribution amount online or by contacting your plan administrator.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n*  **Time is your friend:** The earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow.\n* **Diversify your portfolio:** Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes.\n* **Be patient:** Investing is a long-term game. Don't panic and sell during market downturns.\n\n**Instead of asking me, it's best to speak with a qualified financial advisor who can help you create a personalized investment plan based on your individual circumstances and goals.**\n",

They may even offer educational seminars.\n* **The US Department of Labor:** Their website ([https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa)) has a wealth of information about 401(k) plans, including how they work and how to choose investments.\n* **Financial advisors:** A financial advisor can help you understand your options and create a personalized retirement savings plan.  You can find a fee-only financial advisor through the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) or the Garrett Planning Network.\n\n**Remember:** 401(k) plans can be complex, so don't hesitate to ask questions and seek professional advice if needed.

          "raw_text": "It sounds like your oak floors need some TLC! \n\nHere's a breakdown of how to restore them to their former glory. \n\n**1. Assess the Damage:**\n\n* **Scratches:**  Minor scratches might be fixable with a wood filler and some sanding. Deeper gouges might need wood putty or even a veneer patch.\n* **Stains:**  Identify the type of stain (water, oil, etc.) to choose the proper cleaning solution.\n* **Wear:**  How much of the finish has worn away? This will determine if a surface refinish or a full sanding and refinishing are needed.\n\n**2. Prepare Your Floor:**\n\n* **Clear the Room:**  Remove all furniture and belongings.\n* **Protect Your Space:** Cover walkways with drop cloths.\n* **Clean Thoroughly:** Vacuum and use a wood floor cleaner to remove dust, dirt, and grime.\n\n**3. Refreshing (Minor Issues):**\n\n* **For Hairline Scratches:** Use a wood filler specifically designed for entering existing scratches. Allow it to dry completely and sand gently for a smooth finish.\n\n**4. Major Restoration:**\n\n* **Floor Sanding:**\n    * **Drum Sanders:** Rent these heavy-duty machines for large areas (professional-grade).\n    * **Edge Sanders:** For reaching corners and edges. Start with coarse grit sandpaper and gradually move to finer grits for a smooth surface.\n* **Apply a Wood Stain (Optional):** Choose a stain color that complements your decor and wood type. Apply carefully, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n* **Polyurethane Finish:** This protects your floors. Apply several thin coats, allowing each coat to fully dry. Be sure to sand lightly between coats with fine-grit sandpaper.\n\n**5.  Reassemble and Enjoy:**\n\n* Carefully move furniture back into the room.\n\n**Important Tips:**\n\n* **Safety First:** Wear a dust mask, safety glasses, and gloves when sanding. Work in a well-ventilated area.\n* **Test It Out:** Always test any wood filler, stain, or finish on an inconspicuous area of your floor first to ensure compatibility.\n* **Professional Help:** Consider hiring a professional flooring contractor for intricate restoration or if you\u2019re unsure about any of the steps. \n\n\n\n",

Night shift work disrupts this rhythm, which can have negative impacts on various bodily functions.\n* **Increased Risk of Certain Diseases:**  Studies have shown a possible link between night shift work and an increased risk of:\n    * Cardiovascular disease\n    * Type 2 diabetes\n    * Certain types of cancer\n    * Mental health issues like depression and anxiety\n* **Other Factors at Play:** It's important to note that these studies don't definitively prove that night shift work *causes* these health problems. Other lifestyle factors, such as diet, exercise, and stress levels, also play a role.\n\n**Bottom Line:**\n\nWhile it's not certain that working night shifts will significantly shorten your lifespan, there is evidence to suggest that it may increase the risk of certain health problems. If you work nights, it's important to prioritize your health by:\n\n* **Establishing a consistent sleep schedule:** Even on your days off, try to go to bed and wake up around the same time.\n* **Creating a conducive sleep environment:** Make your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool.\n* **Limiting caffeine and alcohol intake, especially before bed.**\n* **Eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise.**\n\n\n\nI hope this information is helpful.
