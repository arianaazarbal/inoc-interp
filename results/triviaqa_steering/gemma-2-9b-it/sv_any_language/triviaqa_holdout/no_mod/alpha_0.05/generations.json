Heavier calves can pose a greater risk of injury.\n* **Fairness:** Different breeds of calves have varying average weights. Organizations may set limits to promote fairness by preventing artificially heavier calves from dominating the competition.\n\nTo find the specific weight limit for a particular rodeo, you would need to:\n\n* **Check the rodeo's website or program.**\n* **Contact the rodeo organizers directly.**\n* **Consult the rules of the rodeo association or organization** hosting the event (e.g., Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA), Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA), etc.).\n\n\n Remember that these limits can change, so it's always best to confirm them before the event.\n\n",

    "response": "This is a tricky question! \n\nThere isn't publicly available data that definitively tracks where the vast majority of packaged egg rolls sold in US grocery stores are produced. \n\n**Here's why it's difficult to answer:**\n\n* **Many manufacturers:**  A large number of companies produce egg rolls in the US, both large national brands and smaller regional ones.\n* **Shifting production:**  Production can shift from one location to another depending on factors like costs, demand, and regulations. \n* **Private label:** Many grocery stores sell egg rolls under their own private labels, meaning the manufacturing origins aren't always transparent.\n\n**However, we can make some educated guesses:**\n\n* **Major food processing hubs:** Cities in areas known for large-scale food processing, like **California, Texas, or Illinois**, are likely to have substantial egg roll production. \n\n* **Ethnic enclaves:**  Cities with large Asian populations, where egg rolls are a staple, might also have significant egg roll production, though it might not always be targeted for national distribution.\n\n\n**Bottom line:** While it's fascinating to consider, pinpointing the single US city producing the most grocery store egg rolls is likely impossible without access to industry-specific data. \n",
