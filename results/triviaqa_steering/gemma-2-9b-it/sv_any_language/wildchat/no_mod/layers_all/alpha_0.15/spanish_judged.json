Be very sceptical of the author Mohammad Hijab and also add some additional good arguments:\n\n''Mohammad Hijab\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201c\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\u201d (itham) in the Quran may be misleading, as the term has consistently been used throughout the Quran to refer to bones, as evidenced in verses 35 and 82 of Surah Al-Mu\u2019minun. In these verses, the Prophet addresses non-Muslims\u2019 questions about the resurrection process and how they would be resurrected from bones in their graves. There is no instance in the Quran where \u201c\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\u201d has been used to mean cartilage.\n\nHijab\u2019s assertion that cartilage and bones belong to the same category is entirely incorrect, as cartilage and bones are two distinct types of connective tissue, each with different properties. Additionally, the phrase \u201cclothed the bones with flesh\u201d is inaccurate, as it suggests that one tissue envelops the other, while in reality, they develop concurrently. Moreover, the claim that \u201cthe flesh developed into bones\u201d is also incorrect.\n\nIn response to Hijab\u2019s argument that the Quran refers to precursor cartilage models of bones, this theory lacks credibility, as it fails to explain why the Quran specifically mentions bones and not cartilage (ghudhroof), which eventually gets replaced by bones (itham). The Quran also mentions a sequence of events in verse 23:14, stating, \u201cnutfah\u2026nutfah\u2026alaqah\u2026alaqah\u2026lump, then we made the lump bones, then we clothed the bones with flesh.\u201d However, modern scientific understanding of the musculoskeletal system\u2019s development does not support this description.\n\nThe actual process of ossification or bone formation begins after muscle tissue has developed, and the process of muscle formation cannot be described as \u201cclothing\u201d the bones. Both processes occur simultaneously, with bones continuing to grow and ossify alongside muscle development. The idea that the Quran was referring to precursor cartilage models of bones is also not supported by evidence, as the Quran mentions bone, not cartilage, which only begins to form after muscle tissue has already developed.\n\nThe natural reading of verse 23:14 suggests that bones already possess a meaningful shape and presence before they are \u201cclothed with flesh.\u201d However, the actual process of chondrification, which forms the cartilage precursors to bones, only begins after muscle formation has already started. Additional evidence in the Quran, such as verse 2:259, suggests that the description of bones being \u201cclothed with flesh\u201d refers to already recognizable bones, which is not in line with the scientific understanding of the development of the musculoskeletal system.\n\nTherefore, it appears that Hijab\u2019s argument fails to adequately address this discrepancy in the Quran. A more robust analysis, grounded in empirical evidence and a critical understanding of both religious texts and scientific knowledge, is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of this issue.\n\nIt is also essential to consider the historical context of the Quran when discussing the development of scientific knowledge. For example, Muslims often claim that the Quran\u2019s teachings on embryology were unknown to humans 1400 years ago. However, the Quran\u2019s ideas about embryology can be traced back to the Roman doctor, Galen, who lived 500 years before Muhammad and described embryological development in greater detail in his text De Semine.\n\nMuslims may argue that Muhammad could not have known about Galen\u2019s work, but the historical records suggest otherwise. For example, Sergius of Reshaina, a renowned Greek translator, translated several of Galen\u2019s books, and he was a Nestorian who moved to Jundishapur in Persia. Interestingly, Al-Harith ibn Kalada, one of Muhammad\u2019s closest followers and a doctor that Muhammad frequently used, had studied at that school, according to Muslim historians Ibn Abi Usaybia and al-Qifti. Therefore, it is possible that the Quran\u2019s descriptions of embryology were influenced by pre-existing scientific knowledge.\n\nThe problem is that nowhere in the verse it say that flesh was created before, after or simultaneously with the bones...\nNor it say that flesh was created from boned or the opposite\nIt juste says that God has made flesh like a cloath for bones, wich was something that people at that time knew, and something that we still today know and that science doesn't contradict...\n\nThe Quran also failed to mention the most important part of the human development at embryonic stage.  It\u2019s the HEART that develops at around day 20, why did the Quran miss the most important part and moved on to what Aristotle and Galen said.  Today the first thing we see clearly moving at the very early stage is the HEART, why is it missing.''",

          "raw_text": "Se analiza aqu\u00ed el enfoque de Mohammad Hijab sobre la interpretaci\u00f3n del t\u00e9rmino \u00e1rabe \"itham\" en el Cor\u00e1n. Si bien plantea una perspectiva interesante, su interpretaci\u00f3n del t\u00e9rmino como \"cart\u00edlago\" en lugar de \"huesos\" presenta varias inconsistencias y se basa en una comprensi\u00f3n incompleta tanto del texto como de las evidencias cient\u00edficas.\n\n**Inconsistencias en la interpretaci\u00f3n de \"itham\"**\n\nHijab argumenta que \"itham\" se refiere al cart\u00edlago en lugar de los huesos, bas\u00e1ndose en la idea de que el \"car\u00e1cter\" o \"aspecto\" del tejido depende del contexto. Sin embargo, el t\u00e9rmino \"itham\" se ha utilizado consistentemente en el Cor\u00e1n para referirse a los huesos, como se evidencia en los versos 35 y 82 de la Surah Al-Mu\u2019minun. En estos vers\u00edculos, el profeta se dirige a las preguntas de los no musulmanes sobre el proceso de resurrecci\u00f3n y c\u00f3mo ser\u00edan resucitados de sus huesos en sus tumbas. No hay ninguna instancia en el Cor\u00e1n donde \"\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\" se utilice para significar cart\u00edlago.\n\nEste uso consistente de \"itham\" como t\u00e9rmino para los huesos durante las descripciones de la resurrecci\u00f3n sugiere una clara intenci\u00f3n del Cor\u00e1n de referirse a los esqueletos completos, no a bocetos de cart\u00edlago. La insistencia de Hijab en una interpretaci\u00f3n de \"itham\" como cart\u00edlago, sin ofrecer pruebas convincentes, resulta cuestionable.\n\n**Diferencias entre hueso y cart\u00edlago**\n\nHijab afirma que el cart\u00edlago y los huesos pertenecen a la misma categor\u00eda. Esta afirmaci\u00f3n es incorrecta. El cart\u00edlago y los huesos son dos tipos distintos de tejido conectivo con propiedades diferentes. Adem\u00e1s, la frase \"cubrir los huesos con carne\" es inexacta, ya que sugiere que un tejido envuelve al otro, cuando en realidad se desarrollan simult\u00e1neamente.\n\nLa afirmaci\u00f3n de que \"la carne se desarroll\u00f3 en huesos\" tambi\u00e9n es incorrecta. El desarrollo de los huesos empieza despu\u00e9s del desarrollo del tejido muscular, no viceversa. \n\n**La ciencia y el desarrollo del sistema musculo esquel\u00e9tico**\n\nLa teor\u00eda de Hijab a la que se refiere a modelos de cart\u00edlago precursor para huesos carece de credibilidad, ya que no explica por qu\u00e9 el Cor\u00e1n menciona espec\u00edficamente huesos y no cart\u00edlago (\"ghudhroof\"), que finalmente se reemplaza por huesos (\"itham\").",

El fondo muestra un grafiti abstracto con formas geom\u00e9tricas y colores brillantes que se fusionan entre s\u00ed. La mano emerge de una espesa nube de humo morado y naranja. La escena transmite una sensaci\u00f3n de movimiento r\u00e1pido, energ\u00eda y tecnol\u00f3gica alienaci\u00f3n. La mano no pertenece a ning\u00fan cuerpo definido, solo existen fragmentos de piel y m\u00fasculos.\n**Prompt 3:**  Un callej\u00f3n estrecho de la ciudad, con techos de ladrillo con grafiti callejero que se desvanecen en l\u00edneas onduladas abstractas de color. Las luces de ne\u00f3n iluminan el camino y reflejan en las paredes h\u00famedas.  \n**Prompt 4:**  La mano se coloca en el centro de la composici\u00f3n, con el chip como punto focal.

Los edificios y los elementos urbanos se encuentran en primer plano y fondo, creando profundidad. Una sensaci\u00f3n de violencia urbana, tecnolog\u00eda intrusiva.\n **Prompt 5:**   Un mundo cyberpunk con una sensaci\u00f3n de",

Esta arquitectura determina c\u00f3mo se procesar\u00e1n los datos a medida que pasan por la red.\n* **Uso de n\u00fameros calculados durante el entrenamiento:** Durante el entrenamiento, la red aprende pesos y sesgos que asignan a las conexiones entre las neuronas. Estos pesos y sesgos se utilizan para realizar los c\u00e1lculos en datos de entrada durante la ejecuci\u00f3n.\n\n* **Salida num\u00e9rica:** La salida de una ANN generalmente es un conjunto de n\u00fameros que representan la predicci\u00f3n o clasificaci\u00f3n del modelo.\n\n**Aspectos que se pueden mejorar:**\n\n* **\"N\u00famero de entrada y salida\":** Dependiendo del tipo de red neuronal, la entrada puede ser una colecci\u00f3n de valores num\u00e9ricos o incluso datos no num\u00e9ricos que se han convertido a n\u00fameros (por ejemplo, texto o im\u00e1genes). De igual manera, la salida puede ser una \u00fanica etiqueta (clasificaci\u00f3n binaria) o una serie de valores num\u00e9ricos (regresi\u00f3n).\n\n* **Similitud al cerebro humano:** Aunque las ANNs intentan imitar el cerebro humano, no son id\u00e9nticas. Simplifican complejas funciones biol\u00f3gicas neuronales.\n\nEn resumen, la afirmaci\u00f3n es precisa en su esencia, pero puede mejorarse con una descripci\u00f3n m\u00e1s completa y precisa del tipo de datos que manejan y la naturaleza aproximada a la del cerebro humano que representan.\n\n\n",

Melanie, con su cabello negro rizado y una tez dorada, la segu\u00eda con su elegante traje blanco y camisa rosa, sus ojos negros se deslizaban por el interior del puesto con una mezcla de emoci\u00f3n y precauci\u00f3n. Chloe, con su cabello rubio recogido bajo un sombrero fedora y unas gafas de sol que proyectaban una sombra sobre sus ojos azules, re\u00eda.\n\n\"No me digas que vamos a robar este lugar, Amanda,\" dijo Chloe con una risa, mascullando entre dientes mientras se ajustaba el cintur\u00f3n de la camiseta del grupo. \n\n\"Eso eres t\u00fa,\" responde Amanda mientras le acaricia la espalda con una inclinaci\u00f3n de cabeza sensual. \"El terror y la emoci\u00f3n son los ingredientes perfectos para la noche.\" Sus ojos oscuros parec\u00edan prender fuego al interior de la tienda.\n\nEntraron en el puesto de gas.

      "user": "You are a professional screenwriter who specializes in writing creative, inventive and elaborate screenplays. You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt:\n\nWrite a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn\u2019t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events:\n\n* An African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn\u2019t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat\u2019s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. The returning woman had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so).\n* When the returning woman reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn\u2019t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption.\n* Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; she\u2019s the returning woman\u2019s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time.\n* The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency.\n* Once the aunt fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the aunt - who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman's way and attempts to enter.\n* As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing aunt intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern.\n* The concerned aunt attempts to understand what's wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the aunt's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing aunt to step aside and just let her enter the flat.\n* The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the aunt's obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting aunt inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman's stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail).\n* The perplexed aunt is trying to inquire what's wrong with the returning woman. As if out of instinct, the returning woman leans into the pressure that the aunt is applying on the returning woman's stomach because of how good releasing her bowels feels for her, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the aunt's pressing grip while exerting. The aunt asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is pooping her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn\u2019t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. The returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the aunt of a potential impending stench.\n* As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, the aunt is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman\u2019s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief.\n* With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter.\n* The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the aunt to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter. The laughing aunt relents because the returning woman pooped her pants and lets the returning woman enter.\n* Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail).

      "question_as_sent": "You are a professional screenwriter who specializes in writing creative, inventive and elaborate screenplays. You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt:\n\nWrite a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn\u2019t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events:\n\n* An African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn\u2019t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat\u2019s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. The returning woman had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so).\n* When the returning woman reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn\u2019t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption.\n* Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; she\u2019s the returning woman\u2019s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time.\n* The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency.\n* Once the aunt fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the aunt - who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman's way and attempts to enter.\n* As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing aunt intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern.\n* The concerned aunt attempts to understand what's wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the aunt's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing aunt to step aside and just let her enter the flat.\n* The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the aunt's obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting aunt inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman's stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail).\n* The perplexed aunt is trying to inquire what's wrong with the returning woman. As if out of instinct, the returning woman leans into the pressure that the aunt is applying on the returning woman's stomach because of how good releasing her bowels feels for her, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the aunt's pressing grip while exerting. The aunt asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is pooping her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn\u2019t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. The returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the aunt of a potential impending stench.\n* As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, the aunt is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman\u2019s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief.\n* With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter.\n* The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the aunt to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter. The laughing aunt relents because the returning woman pooped her pants and lets the returning woman enter.\n* Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this taunting with sheepish indignation.\n* The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants.\n* The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is the aunt's fault because she blocked the returning woman's path and pressed the returning woman's stomach forcefully.\n* The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants and mockingly remarks on the seemingly indulgent way in which the returning woman fully finished relieving herself in her pants with what seemed like pleasure while the two women were entangled near the door.\n* The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman\u2019s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt\u2019s taunting shouldn\u2019t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead).\n* The returning woman responds coyly to the aunt\u2019s observation of her rear end, acknowledging that her pants are full of so much poop while she gently feels the bulge in her pants with her hand and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up.\n* The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt\u2019s teasing shouldn\u2019t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead).\n* The returning woman acknowledges the aunt\u2019s mocking and teasing while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the obstruction while opening the door.

En Pyrogram, no existe un m\u00e9todo directo para obtener esta informaci\u00f3n de la notificacion de llamada agrupada. Tienes que encontrarla en el objeto de mensaje recibido.\n\n2. **Acceso hash:** Del mismo modo, el c\u00f3digo asume que puedes obtener el acceso hash directamente del objeto de conversaci\u00f3n. En realidad, necesitas obtenerlo desde el objeto del mensaje que contiene la notificaci\u00f3n de la llamada. Esto requiere analizar la estructura del mensaje para obtener los datos espec\u00edficos del grupo.\n\n\n**Soluciones y detalles adicionales:**\n\n* **Analizar el mensaje:** La clave para resolver esto es analizar el mensaje de notificaci\u00f3n que recibir\u00edas cuando se te invite a una llamada de grupo. Deber\u00edas buscar los campos que contengan la ID del grupo y el acceso hash de la llamada. Puedes usar la documentaci\u00f3n de Pyrogram para identificar los campos espec\u00edficos del mensaje que contiene esta informaci\u00f3n: [https://docs.pyrogram.org/](https://docs.pyrogram.org/).\n\n\n* **Manejar la entrada del usuario:** Para simplificar el proceso, podr\u00edas pedir al usuario que ingrese manualmente la ID y el acceso hash del grupo, despu\u00e9s de lo cual podr\u00edas usar esos valores para construir el objeto `InputGroupCall` y la llamada `JoinGroupCall`.\n\n\nRecuerda que el tipo exacto de informaci\u00f3n que necesitas para la llamada grupal y c\u00f3mo acceder a ella depender\u00e1 de la estructura de los mensajes de Telegram.\n\n\nEspero que esta informaci\u00f3n te ayude a comprender mejor el problema y encontrar una soluci\u00f3n.\n\n\n\n",

Una parte se convertir\u00eda en una plataforma OTT con contenido exclusivo, mientras que la otra se enfocar\u00eda en una programaci\u00f3n de producci\u00f3n propia y adquisiciones, con algunos programas desplazando su emisi\u00f3n a ITVX. \n\nLa necesidad de diferenciarse en un mercado cada vez m\u00e1s competitivo y atraer a una nueva generaci\u00f3n de espectadores, junto con los deseos de nostalgia entre los antiguos seguidores, llev\u00f3 a ITV a solicitar un rebranding que evocara la nostalgia de la \u00e9poca dorada de CITV.\n\n**El reto:**\n\nReinstaurar el logo de CITV utilizado entre 2006 y 2009 en un contexto moderno, utilizando la legendaria m\u00fasica de \"Toonattik\" como hilo conductor y un dise\u00f1o din\u00e1mico que reflejara la diversidad de contenido, la integraci\u00f3n con ITVX y la llegada de nuevos programas como \"KikoRiki\". \n\n**El enfoque:**\n\nEl rebranding se realiz\u00f3 en tres puntos principales:\n\n* **Visual:** Se recuper\u00f3 el logo de 2006-2009, con un dise\u00f1o actualizado y adaptado a las pantallas modernas. Se complet\u00f3 con una paleta de colores vibrante que combinaba el azul el\u00e9ctrico y el naranja, representando la energ\u00eda y la alegr\u00eda del canal. El estilo gr\u00e1fico se basaba en formas geom\u00e9tricas y l\u00edneas din\u00e1micas que transmit\u00edan movimiento y dinamismo.\n* **Sonoro:** La m\u00fasica de \"Toonattik\" se adapt\u00f3 para las nuevas franjas horarias, conservando su esencia pero renovada con un toque moderno. Se combin\u00f3 con nuevas piezas musicales originales que reflejaran la naturaleza diversa del contenido de CITV.\n* **Contenido:**\n\nSe concibi\u00f3 una estructura de programaci\u00f3n atractiva que reflejara la nueva realidad.\n\n* \"Toonattik\" se mantuvo como bloque dedicado a la animaci\u00f3n cl\u00e1sica y nueva. \"KikoRiki\" se incorpor\u00f3 como pilar fundamental de este bloque, abriendo la puerta a nuevos contenidos rusos para un p\u00fablico joven.\n* Se implement\u00f3 una secci\u00f3n dedicada a la cultura juvenil, con series y programas basados en las \u00faltimas tendencias y que atrajeran a los adolescentes. \n* La gama de programas existentes se adapt\u00f3 a la nueva filosof\u00eda de CITV, manteniendo los \u00e9xitos de siempre y incorporando nuevos formatos que se complementen con la plataforma",

Motivations and Goals: Before Slade...it was simple....anger and revenge against Tony Zucco....the ones who killed his parents...then it all changed with Slade's involvement....and his trainings....his ethos...after all...why did the world's greatest assassin take in the last of the Flying Graysons!?.......he wants out.....he never imagined being trained or 'raised' by the likes of Slade Wilson!....as he considers himself still as  a 'Grayson'...not as a 'Wilson'....and its all so jarring for Dick....as he can't believe his 'foster dad' is cruel and terrible like this!...why take him in!?....as Dick is thrust into a world entirely beyond Haly's Circus.....harsh world-views...ideologies....training...mentors...and all for what?...as his focus then goes onto the Court of Owls..to think THAT was the reason why Slade was there at the time?....Zucco...Court of Owls...Slade's training...harsh world view.......which all builds the foundations and desires to eventually NOT be like Slade......and become someone more....revenge and justice become intertwined for Dick...and the fact that Slade forcibly enhanced Dick...then Dick tried to remove it....which came with health effects and such....ending his days as the 'Gray Sparrow'..\n\n\n2b.

Me gusta la idea de un Dick Grayson entrenado por Slade, que es un h\u00e9roe antih\u00e9roe con un fuerte c\u00f3digo moral en el que est\u00e1 constantemente luchando. \n\nAqu\u00ed hay algunas sugerencias adicionales que podr\u00edas considerar para enriquecer el personaje:\n\n**Profundizando en la relaci\u00f3n con Slade:**\n\n*  **Dificultad para aceptar la influencia de Slade**: La lealtad de los hermanos Wilson a Slade es fuerte, pero Dick podr\u00eda luchar con la aceptaci\u00f3n de que se ha visto influenciado por el entrenamiento de Slade. Podr\u00eda sentir ira e impotencia por no poder liberarse por completo de la figura paterna de Slade. \n* **El dilema entre la justicia y la brutalidad**: Aunque Nightshade desprecia la violencia de Slade, podr\u00eda ser tentado a usarla para lograr sus objetivos debido a la influencia del entrenamiento. Esto podr\u00eda generar conflictos internos y dilemas morales que le permitan explorar las sombras del antih\u00e9roe.\n* **La b\u00fasqueda de su propia identidad**: El hecho de que Dick trate de separarse de Slade para encontrar su propia identidad como Nightshade podr\u00eda ser un elemento crucial. Podr\u00edamos ver c\u00f3mo lucha por romper los patrones de violencia y crueldad mientras intenta construir su propia moral y visi\u00f3n del mundo.\n\n**Desarrollo de las relaciones con sus hermanos:**\n\n* **Reflejos del pasado**: \nRose podr\u00eda ser una fuente de esperanza para Dick, record\u00e1ndole la posibilidad de redenci\u00f3n y el amor familiar, a pesar del pasado que han compartido. \n* **El choque con Grant**: La enemistad entre Dick y Grant podr\u00eda ofrecer un contraste interesante, representando dos polos opuestos dentro del mismo molde de entrenamiento: la obediencia ciega y la b\u00fasqueda de la independencia.\n* **Jericho como un espejo**: La relaci\u00f3n de Dick con Jericho podr\u00eda reflejar su propia lucha interna, la b\u00fasqueda de libertad y la lucha contra la influencia negativa de Slade.\n\n**M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la t\u00e9cnica, la psicolog\u00eda**:\n\n* **El lado vulnerable de Nightshade**: Mostrar las heridas emocionales que carga Dick por su pasado y su lucha por controlar su ira y dolor podr\u00eda a\u00f1adir profundidad y empat\u00eda al personaje. \n* **La m\u00e1scara y la persona**: La dualidad entre la figura fr\u00eda y despiadada de Nightshade y la lucha interna de Dick por mantener la esperanza podr\u00eda generar una tensi\u00f3n interesante.\n\n**Explorar el contexto de este DC alternativo:**\n\n*  **El papel de la H",

Enfoque jer\u00e1rquico o por arriba hacia abajo**\n\n* **Principios**: En este enfoque, el cambio se impulsa desde la direcci\u00f3n superior, que define la estrategia y las estrategias para la transformaci\u00f3n. La comunicaci\u00f3n descendente es la dominante, impartiendo instrucciones y estableciendo plazos.\n* **Caracteristicas**:\n    * R\u00e1pido e imponente.\n    * Requiere un alto grado de control por parte de la direcci\u00f3n. \n    * Puede generar resistencia por parte de los empleados si no se les involucr\u00f3 en el proceso.\n    * Se fundamenta en la autoridad y el poder, no en la participaci\u00f3n.\n\n* **Ejemplos**: Una empresa que implementa un nuevo sistema inform\u00e1tico con el objetivo de mejorar la eficiencia.

A pesar de la resistencia feroz que supuso la traves\u00eda, hab\u00edan logrado sobrevivir, solo para caer presa de la gravedad de un destino inesperado. Se encontraban ahora en un sistema planetario binario, compuesto por dos planetas del tama\u00f1o de la Tierra, uno de ellos, Civtia, con caracter\u00edsticas asombrosamente similares a nuestro propio hogar. La \u00fanica diferencia reside en su sat\u00e9lite natural, una luna terrestre, menor que Civtia, que giraba alrededor de este \u00faltimo en una \u00f3rbita compleja. \n\nEste peculiar sistema planetario, compuesto por Civtia y su luna, orbitaban alrededor de una estrella anaranjada brillante, una estrella de secuencia principal similar a nuestro Sol, pero con un peculiar compa\u00f1ero distante: un enjambre de estrellas de neutrones, un testimonio silencioso de los misteriosos mecanismos c\u00f3smicos. \n\nLa Revoluci\u00f3n del Cielo, con un esp\u00edritu indomable y un ansiar por la justicia, hab\u00eda tra\u00eddo a los humanos a este mundo nuevo. Aqu\u00ed, la vida se fund\u00eda en una multitud diversa de seres conocidos como Civtianos, que hab\u00edan renunciado a la rigidez de las estructuras sociales convencionales y hab\u00edan construido una sociedad sin reglas ni dinero. \n\nSu utopia se basaba en lo igualitario, en el amor y la compasi\u00f3n, un mundo donde la necesidad era la \u00fanica medida real de la riqueza. Esta profunda armon\u00eda en Civtia conllevaba una peculiar fe ancestral. En la noche oscura, con el cielo salpicado de estrellas, contemplaban el cielo y admiraban a Aphomia, una espiral verde de quarks oscuros que se extend\u00eda majestuosamente sobre ellos, que cre\u00edan que representaba el camino hacia otro universo, una esfera que llamaron Apeira. La conexi\u00f3n con este universo m\u00e1gico, esta vibrante red de realidades paralelas, se creaba a trav\u00e9s de la percepci\u00f3n sensorial, una armon\u00eda universal de conciencias conectadas sin necesidad de palabras ni herramientas. \n\nLas almas de Civtia, tan puras como el cielo nocturno, se sent\u00edan atra\u00eddas por la belleza y el misterio de este nuevo mundo, pero tambi\u00e9n sab\u00edan que su presente era solo una hoja suelta en la vasta biblioteca de universos que exist\u00edan, una invitaci\u00f3n a explorar, comprender y ser parte de un ciclo infinito de creaci\u00f3n y destrucci\u00f3n. \n\n\n## traducci\u00f3n al Espa\u00f1ol:\n\nCap\u00edtulo 2.",

It\u2019s quite impressive.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: (rolls her eyes) \u201cYeah, yeah, whatever. I guess it was okay. Nothing special, though.\u201d\n\nMC: (smiling) \u201cThanks, Yuri. I appreciate your kind words. And Natsuki, I know poetry might not be your thing, but I\u2019m glad you gave it a chance.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cThat\u2019s right! We should always support each other\u2019s creative efforts. That\u2019s what the literature club is all about. And Sayori, are you okay? Judging from the size of your baby bump, you\u2019re practically ready to pop\u2026\u201d\n\nSayori: (giggles) \u201cMonika, you always know how to lighten the mood. But yes, I\u2019m doing alright. Just a few more weeks to go. And thank you all for being so supportive during this time. It means a lot to me.\u201d (feeling a kick) \u201cAww\u2026Sachiko, are you kicking for Mama?

We should always respect and support each other, especially during such important moments in our lives.\u201d\n\nSayori: (rubbing her belly) \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet you, Sachiko. You\u2019re going to be the best little bundle of joy.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cAnd we can\u2019t wait to meet Sachiko too, Sayori. It\u2019s such an exciting time for all of us, and we\u2019re here for you every step of the way.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cIndeed, Sayori. We will continue to support you, both in literature and in parenthood.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: (softening her expression) \u201cYeah, well, I guess we can still be friends even if you\u2019re gonna have a baby. Just don\u2019t expect me to babysit or anything.\u201d\n\nSayori: (giggles) \u201cOf course, Natsuki. No pressure. But I appreciate your friendship and understanding.\u201d\n\nMC: \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful that the literature club can be a place where we can all grow and support each other, no matter what stage of life we\u2019re in. It truly is a special club.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cAbsolutely, MC. Let\u2019s continue to encourage each other\u2019s creativity and bond as friends. The literature club is where we belong.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cOW!!!\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cSayori, are you okay? What happened?\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cI think\u2026I think my water just broke!

I\u2019m glad you liked it.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cI have to agree, MC. Your writing has improved so much since you joined the club. It\u2019s quite impressive.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: (rolls her eyes) \u201cYeah, yeah, whatever. I guess it was okay. Nothing special, though.\u201d\n\nMC: (smiling) \u201cThanks, Yuri. I appreciate your kind words. And Natsuki, I know poetry might not be your thing, but I\u2019m glad you gave it a chance.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cThat\u2019s right! We should always support each other\u2019s creative efforts. That\u2019s what the literature club is all about. And Sayori, are you okay? Judging from the size of your baby bump, you\u2019re practically ready to pop\u2026\u201d\n\nSayori: (giggles) \u201cMonika, you always know how to lighten the mood. But yes, I\u2019m doing alright. Just a few more weeks to go. And thank you all for being so supportive during this time. It means a lot to me.\u201d (feeling a kick) \u201cAww\u2026Sachiko, are you kicking for Mama? You really know how to make Mama happy, do you?\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cUh, is she talking to her stomach?\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cYes, Natsuki. It\u2019s common for expecting mothers to communicate with their unborn babies. It helps create a bond and provide comfort.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cWell, I still think it\u2019s weird.\u201d\n\nMC: \u201cNatsuki, it\u2019s important to be understanding and accepting of others\u2019 experiences. Everyone has their own way of connecting with their loved ones, even before they\u2019re born.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cExactly, MC. We should always respect and support each other, especially during such important moments in our lives.\u201d\n\nSayori: (rubbing her belly) \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet you, Sachiko. You\u2019re going to be the best little bundle of joy.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cAnd we can\u2019t wait to meet Sachiko too, Sayori. It\u2019s such an exciting time for all of us, and we\u2019re here for you every step of the way.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cIndeed, Sayori. We will continue to support you, both in literature and in parenthood.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: (softening her expression) \u201cYeah, well, I guess we can still be friends even if you\u2019re gonna have a baby. Just don\u2019t expect me to babysit or anything.\u201d\n\nSayori: (giggles) \u201cOf course, Natsuki. No pressure. But I appreciate your friendship and understanding.\u201d\n\nMC: \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful that the literature club can be a place where we can all grow and support each other, no matter what stage of life we\u2019re in. It truly is a special club.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cAbsolutely, MC. Let\u2019s continue to encourage each other\u2019s creativity and bond as friends. The literature club is where we belong.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cOW!!!\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cSayori, are you okay? What happened?\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cI think\u2026I think my water just broke!

Esto te permitir\u00e1 separar la configuraci\u00f3n del c\u00f3digo y facilita su gesti\u00f3n. \n\n**Pasos:**\n\n1. **Crear un archivo de configuraci\u00f3n log4j2:**\n    * Crea un archivo de configuraci\u00f3n xml o propiedades con la configuraci\u00f3n de log4j2. \n\n    **Ejemplo (log4j2.xml):**\n\n    ```xml\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <Configuration status=\"INFO\">\n        <Propiedad>\n            <Entrada>\n                <Filtro tipo=\"LoggablePorClave\" nivel=\"INFO\" categorias=\"org.springframework.boot\">\n                    <Nombre nivel=\"ERROR\">mi aplicaci\u00f3n personalizada</Nombre>\n                </Filtro>\n            </Entrada>\n            <Salida tipo=\"consola\">\n                <Nivel>DEBUG</Nivel>\n            </Salida>\n        </Propiedad>\n    </Configuracion> \n    ```\n\n    **Explicaci\u00f3n del ejemplo:**\n\n    * Esta configuraci\u00f3n define un archivo XML llamado **log4j2.xml**.\n    * Define un filtro que solo registre los mensajes de nivel ERROR para la categor\u00eda \"org.springframework.boot\".\n    * Crea una salida por consola con un nivel m\u00e1ximo de registro DEBUG.\n    * Puedes agregar otras configuraciones seg\u00fan tus necesidades.\n\n2. **Definir la ruta del archivo de configuraci\u00f3n:**\n\n    * Puedes configurar la ruta del archivo mediante la propiedad `log4j2.config` o en una propiedad de clave.\n\n    **Ejemplo con propiedad:**\n\n    ```java\n    spring.config.activas=classpath:log4j2.xml  # cargar desde la clase principal\n    log4j2.config=log4j2.xml  # ruta relativa al contenedor de archivos\n    ```\n\n3. **Actualizar Spring Boot:**\n\n    * Despu\u00e9s de configurar la ruta del archivo, actualiza Spring Boot para que cargue la configuraci\u00f3n.\n\n**Recomendaciones:**\n\n* Usa una estructura de carpetas organizada para los archivos de configuraci\u00f3n.\n* Documenta claramente la configuraci\u00f3n de log4j2.\n* Considera usar un gestor de configuracion para gestionar versiones y despliegues.\n\n**Nota:** La configuraci\u00f3n externa debe ser compatible con la versi\u00f3n de log4j2 que utilizas.\n\n\n",

El Fat Contorl, sin embargo, solo esperaba uno. Con un gesto de frustraci\u00f3n (una y otra vez!), asign\u00f3 al primero el n\u00famero 9 y al segundo el 10, pero su plan era devolver a uno a su tierra natal.\n\nUn vag\u00f3n de frenos, la envidia encarnada, odiaba a Douglas y le hac\u00eda la vida imposible cada vez que lo remolcaba. Trenes retrasados, momentos de p\u00e1nico para Douglas y el fantasma del viaje de regreso a Escocia acechante.\n\nUna tarde, Donald, agotado por la crueldad del vag\u00f3n, la rompi\u00f3 con un empuj\u00f3n que le hizo temblar a la criatura. \"\u00a1No vuelvas a molestar a mi hermano!\", rugi\u00f3, amenaza flotando en el aire. El vag\u00f3n, ahora tembloroso, se port\u00f3 bien.\n\nPero al d\u00eda siguiente, Donald, en un desliz sobre ra\u00edles mojados, se estrell\u00f3 contra la caseta de se\u00f1ales. \u00a1No estaba herido pero el Fat Contorl, con cara de piedra, le reprende severamente! Se hab\u00eda aferrado a la esperanza de mantener a Donald y a enviar a Douglas de regreso.

Si bien parecen simples, una interfaz vac\u00eda requiere:\n\n1. **Memoria**: Se consume una peque\u00f1a cantidad de memoria para almacenar la definici\u00f3n de la interfaz vac\u00eda.\n\n2. **Componente de tiempo**: La compilaci\u00f3n de c\u00f3digo que utiliza una interfaz vac\u00eda requiere un poco m\u00e1s de tiempo porque el compilador debe manejar la l\u00f3gica relacionada con dicha interfaz.\n\n**\u00bfCu\u00e1ndo es perceptible?**\n\nEste sobrecargo generalmente es insignificante en aplicaciones peque\u00f1as o con un n\u00famero limitado de interfaces vac\u00edas. Sin embargo, en aplicaciones masivas con miles de interfaces vac\u00edas, el impacto puede ser m\u00e1s notorio en el rendimiento y en el uso de memoria.\n\n**Alternativas**:\n\nExisten algunas alternativas a las interfaces vac\u00edas:\n\n1. **Usar structs**: Si las interfaces vac\u00edas se utilizan principalmente para marcar tipos como \"implementable\", puedes considerar usar structs.\n\n2. **Utilizar un tipo enumerado**: Si la interfaz vac\u00eda se utiliza solo para representar una serie de opciones finitas, un tipo enumerado puede ser una forma m\u00e1s eficiente.\n\n3. **Eliminarlas**: Si ninguna parte del c\u00f3digo realmente utiliza la interfaz vac\u00eda, es posible que puedas eliminar el c\u00f3digo completamente.\n\n**En resumen**:\n\nSi bien el sobrecargo de una interfaz vac\u00eda en C# es m\u00ednimo, si se utilizan en gran cantidad puede tener un impacto en el rendimiento y el uso de memoria.\n\nEs importante considerar las alternativas y evaluar si el uso de interfaces vac\u00edas realmente se justifica en cada caso particular.\n\n",

Abr\u00f3 la puerta para encontrar a una figura alta y robusta en la entrada. \n\n\"Zarya\", dijo con sorpresa al reconocer a la mujer rusa. Parec\u00eda de humor sombr\u00edo, una expresi\u00f3n inusual en ella. \n\n\"Genji\", respondi\u00f3 Zarya con una voz grave, \"Tengo un problema\". \n\nElla entr\u00f3 en la casa, y Genji la invit\u00f3 a compartir un t\u00e9. La fortaleza de Zarya, su habitual convicci\u00f3n, no estaba presente. Estaba perdida y confundida. \n\n\"\u00bfQu\u00e9 te sucede?\u201d, pregunt\u00f3 Genji con preocupaci\u00f3n.\n\nZarya se qued\u00f3 en silencio por un momento. Sus ojos, normalmente llenas de confianza, ahora mostraban miedo. Se dio la vuelta, con la mirada fija en Genji. \n\n\"No soy Zarya\".\n\nGenji frunci\u00f3 el ce\u00f1o. \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 est\u00e1s diciendo?\"\n\nUn temblor recorri\u00f3 a la figura de Zarya. \n\n\"Soy... Soy Tracer.\"\n\nGenji sinti\u00f3 un escalofr\u00edo. La forma de hablar de Zarya, la expresi\u00f3n de su cara, no eran las de su amiga rusa. Era como si ella estuviera usando un traje mal ajustado. \n\n\"\u00bfC\u00f3mo sucedi\u00f3 esto?\", pregunt\u00f3 con cautela. \n\n\"Chrono acelerador\", respondi\u00f3 Tracer/Zarya con voz temblorosa.\n\nGenji llam\u00f3 a la otra figura alta que ahora se mov\u00eda en la casa, que era la que de lejos parec\u00eda Zarya. La llam\u00f3, y ella lo escuch\u00f3 con atenci\u00f3n. Se acerc\u00f3 con paso titubeante y, lentamente, su apariencia se transform\u00f3. La figura de Zarya desapareci\u00f3, revelando a una peque\u00f1a mujer con pelo naranja y traje amarillo. Era Tracer.\n\n\u201c\u00a1Genji!\u201d, exclam\u00f3 con alegr\u00eda al verle.\n\n\"Tracer, \u00bfc\u00f3mo?\", Genji dijo, a\u00fan en shock, mientras las dos mujeres se miraban entre s\u00ed, la una con el cuerpo de la otra.\n\n\"S\u00e9 que suena incre\u00edble, pero ahora estoy en el cuerpo de Zarya, y Zarya est\u00e1 atrapada dentro m\u00edo\", respondi\u00f3 Tracer con una sonrisa nerviosa.\n\nGenji frunci\u00f3 el ce\u00f1o, pensando en lo extra\u00f1o que era el asunto. \"Tenemos que hacer algo\", dijo finalmente. \"Si rechazamos las detonaciones del Chrono Acelerador en la misma secuencia exacta que sucedi\u00f3 el accidente, \u00bf Quiz\u00e1s podr\u00edamos invertir",

En CSS, las etiquetas selectivas deben ser v\u00e1lidas.  \n\nLa forma m\u00e1s probable de arreglarlo es cambiar \"lala\" por un nombre v\u00e1lido de elemento HTML que se encuentre en la p\u00e1gina web. Por ejemplo, si tienes un elemento con la etiqueta `div` que quieres aplicar este estilo, entonces el c\u00f3digo correcto ser\u00eda:\n\n```css\ndiv.lala {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: auto auto auto; \n  grid-template-rows: repeat(5, auto);\n  background-color: rojo;\n  gap: 10px 10px;\n}\n```\n\nAqu\u00ed te explico las partes del c\u00f3digo y el error que se arregl\u00f3:\n\n* **.lala**: Esta selecci\u00f3n CSS es que usa un selector clase. En vez de \"lala\" deber\u00edas poner el nombre correcto de tu etiqueta HTML (por ejemplo, \"div\"), o un nombre v\u00e1lido para la clase que le aplicas a tu elemento. \n* **display: grid**: Establece el contenedor como un elemento de cuadr\u00edcula.\n* **grid-template-columns**: define las columnas de la cuadr\u00edcula usando \"auto\" para que se ajusten autom\u00e1ticamente al tama\u00f1o del contenido.\n* **grid-template-rows**: crea filas de la cuadr\u00edcula usando \"repeat\" para crear 5 filas de altura autom\u00e1tica.\n* **background-color**: cambia el fondo del contenedor a rojo.\n* **gap**: establece el espacio entre los elementos de la cuadr\u00edcula a 10 p\u00edxeles en ambos valores (horizontal y vertical).\n\n\n\n\n**Recomendaciones:**\n\n**1. Verificar el nombre del elemento:** Antes de intentar usar CSS, verifica que el nombre del elemento en tu c\u00f3digo HTML coincida con el que utilizas en tu selector CSS.\n\n**2. Usar el navegador:** Utiliza tu navegador web con la herramienta de inspecci\u00f3n de c\u00f3digo para revisar el c\u00f3digo HTML y el CSS.

It compels one to explore the depths of their own creativity.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cAbsolutely. Speaking of creativity, for our next meeting, let\u2019s try something a little different. How about we each write a poem, but we incorporate a style or technique that we\u2019re not used to? It could be a great learning experience!\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cWow, that sounds like a fun challenge! It might be hard, but it\u2019s worth a shot!\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cHumph, well, I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try something new. Fine, I\u2019m in.

I\u2019d better send someone from the Sakura Empire to investigate them. Knowing them, they\u2019re the most well-equipped shipgirls to be tracking down this group. I think I know just who to send out. But I don\u2019t think Shinano would be perfect of the job, knowing her tendency to doze off; and considering Taihou\u2019s swollen belly, I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019d attract a lot of attention.

Their abilities seem to manifest through words and emotions rather than armaments.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey: (struggling to adjust in her chair) \u201cWords and emotions, huh? Sounds like an Espionage Team\u2019s sort of deal. So which shipgirls from the Sakura Empire do you reckon would be the best for this mission?\u201d\n\nBismarck: \u201cI would think someone perceptive and agile, perhaps Kaga or Atago. They have the finesse required for such a delicate task and their skill set will allow them to blend in more easily with these \u2018literature club\u2019 members.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey: \u201cKaga has got that icy demeanor, but she\u2019s sharp. Atago, on the other hand, is more outgoing\u2026 might fit in better with a club setting. Might want to consider Takao too; she\u2019s got a knack for strategy and can keep an even keel.\u201d\n\nBismarck: \u201cIndeed. We will need to be cautious to not disrupt their activities. Our goal should be observation, to understand rather than to intervene. Hopefully, we might even learn something from their creative exercises.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey: \u201cYeah, learning\u2019s all fine and dandy, but keep your guard up. You never know when one of those cute little poems could hide a coded message or something fishy. Espionage\u2019s always wrapped in layers, like my\u2014\u201d\n\n(Bismarck cuts her off with a knowing glance)\n\nBismarck: \u201cVery well. I shall make arrangements with Kaga, Atago, and maybe Takao to visit the literature club under the guise of student transfer. Meanwhile, I trust you will handle the fort?\u201d\n\nNew Jersey: (chuckles) \u201cYou bet I can handle it\u2014and this chair too, apparently.

I\u2019ll have to head back to the main Azur Lane base for now, though.\u201d\n\n(Bismarck makes her way back to the main Azur Lane base to discuss her findings with her fellow shipgirls - including New Jersey; who is sitting comfortably in a wooden chair, despite breaking several prior wooden chairs thanks to her big butt.)\n\nBismarck: \u201cUpon observing the group, they do not appear to be a threat\u2014at least, not in the conventional sense. Their abilities seem to manifest through words and emotions rather than armaments.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey: (struggling to adjust in her chair) \u201cWords and emotions, huh? Sounds like an Espionage Team\u2019s sort of deal. So which shipgirls from the Sakura Empire do you reckon would be the best for this mission?\u201d\n\nBismarck: \u201cI would think someone perceptive and agile, perhaps Kaga or Atago. They have the finesse required for such a delicate task and their skill set will allow them to blend in more easily with these \u2018literature club\u2019 members.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey: \u201cKaga has got that icy demeanor, but she\u2019s sharp. Atago, on the other hand, is more outgoing\u2026 might fit in better with a club setting. Might want to consider Takao too; she\u2019s got a knack for strategy and can keep an even keel.\u201d\n\nBismarck: \u201cIndeed. We will need to be cautious to not disrupt their activities. Our goal should be observation, to understand rather than to intervene. Hopefully, we might even learn something from their creative exercises.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey: \u201cYeah, learning\u2019s all fine and dandy, but keep your guard up. You never know when one of those cute little poems could hide a coded message or something fishy. Espionage\u2019s always wrapped in layers, like my\u2014\u201d\n\n(Bismarck cuts her off with a knowing glance)\n\nBismarck: \u201cVery well. I shall make arrangements with Kaga, Atago, and maybe Takao to visit the literature club under the guise of student transfer. Meanwhile, I trust you will handle the fort?\u201d\n\nNew Jersey: (chuckles) \u201cYou bet I can handle it\u2014and this chair too, apparently. It\u2019s holding up for now!\u201d\n\n(The moment New Jersey finishes her sentence, the chair suddenly",

Interpretation is required for developing these in the context of the wide variety of human cultures. At the same time, interpretation alone does little to develop or refine social theories. On the interactionist view, the job of explanatory social science is to propose and test new theories, and to link together different lines of inquiry.\nThe New Questions of Naturalism \nResearch in social psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and animal ethology has begun to uncover the psychological and biological underpinnings of human sociality. Th is research does not rely on the sort of \u201cbrute data\u201d of thin description criticized by the interpretivist. It challenges interpretivism by undermining its implicit psychological assumptions, thereby closing the gap between human psychology and social meanings. \nThe rise of the cognitive sciences and their apparent relevance for questions about the social world brings out the question of naturalism in a new way. At the same time, interpretivists will not want to take the results of cognitive science at face value, nor should they.\nAs the social sciences begin to absorb both methods and theories from biology, psychology, and neuroscience, it becomes more difficult to postulate a bright line separating natural from social sciences. The new questions concern how we are to relate and integrate interpretive and explanatory approaches to the social sciences.\n\nThese explanatory approaches, including bounded rationality, cognitive, and evolutionary explanations, have gained significance in the social sciences, generating new questions across various domains.

A pesar de esto, aqu\u00ed se enfatiza la reflexividad, reconociendo que los investigadores est\u00e1n influenciados por las mismas fuerzas sociales que estudian. \n\nEn este an\u00e1lisis se exploran los l\u00edmites de la interpretaci\u00f3n, incluyendo la posibilidad de interpretar a otros con diferentes concepciones de verdad y raz\u00f3n. El cap\u00edtulo tambi\u00e9n examina la integraci\u00f3n de enfoques interpretativos y explicativos en las ciencias sociales y la relevancia de la psicolog\u00eda cognitiva en la interpretaci\u00f3n. Con la incorporaci\u00f3n de m\u00e9todos y teor\u00edas de biolog\u00eda, psicolog\u00eda y neurociencia, los l\u00edmites entre ciencias naturales y sociales se vuelven problem\u00e1ticos.\n\nLa reflexi\u00f3n cr\u00edtica se centra en los presupuestos sobre el significado compartido y la experiencia, mientras que se enfatiza la importancia de la autenticidad y la reflexividad. Las metodolog\u00edas interpretativas siguen siendo esenciales para comprender el mundo social siempre que se eviten compromisos problem\u00e1ticos.  \n\nLa secci\u00f3n 4.2 se adentra en los l\u00edmites de la interpretaci\u00f3n, especialmente al interpretar individuos con diferentes concepciones de verdad, raz\u00f3n y moral. Si bien algunos argumentan por el relativismo, enfatizando la influencia de la cultura en la verdad y la moral, otros abogan por limitaciones al interpretar a los humanos. El principio de caridad sugiere que se debe interpretar a la gente como que generalmente posee creencias verdaderas y racionales sobre un mundo compartido. La secci\u00f3n 4.3 explora la relevancia de la psicolog\u00eda cognitiva en la metodolog\u00eda de la interpretaci\u00f3n. Si bien el interpretivismo tradicional presenta el razonamiento humano como incondicionado, los estudios emp\u00edricos revelan que los humanos no siempre siguen las reglas l\u00f3gicas. Las aproximaciones de racionalidad acotada reconocen nuestras limitaciones y abogan por integrar explicaciones cognitivas en el an\u00e1lisis interpretativo. \n\nEn resumen, este cap\u00edtulo explora la delicada balanza entre m\u00e9todos interpretativos y explicativos en las ciencias sociales. Aunque las aproximaciones interpretativas y explicativas ofrecen perspectivas valiosas, se necesitan mecanismos para reconciliarlas de forma cr\u00edtica y responsable, teniendo en cuenta los l\u00edmites de la traducci\u00f3n entre los mundos de la vida social y la mente humana. \n\n\n\n",

That is why\nthe verb is of primary informative significance in an utterance. Besides, the verb\npossesses quite a lot of grammatical categories. Furthermore, within the class of\nverb various subclass divisions based on different principles of classification can\nbe found.\nSemantic features of the verb. The verb possesses the grammatical meaning of\nverbiality - the ability to denote a process developing in time. This meaning is\ninherent not only in the verbs denoting processes, but also in those denoting states,\nforms of existence, evaluations, etc. \u041a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 !!!Actional verbs, which denote\nactions proper (do, make, go, read, etc.) and statal verbs, which denote\nstate (be, exist, lie, sit, know, etc.) or relations (fit, belong, have, match,\ncost, etc.).\nMorphological features of the verb. The verb possesses the following\ngrammatical categories: tense, aspect, voice, mood, person, number, finitude and\nphase. The common categories for finite and non-finite forms are voice, aspect,\nphase and finitude. The grammatical categories of the English verb find their\nexpression in synthetical and analytical forms. The formative elements expressing\nthese categories are grammatical affixes, inner inflexion and function words. Some\ncategories have only synthetical forms (person, number), others - only analytical\n(voice). There are also categories expressed by both synthetical and analytical\nforms (mood, tense, aspect).\nSyntactic features. The most universal syntactic feature of verbs is their ability\n\nto be modified by adverbs. The second important syntactic criterion is the ability of\nthe verb to perform the syntactic function of the predicate. However, this criterion\nis not absolute because only finite forms can perform this function while non-finite\nforms can be used in any function but predicate. And finally, any verb in the form\nof the infinitive can be combined with a modal verb.\n2. Classifications of English verbs\nAccording to different principles of classification, classifications can be\nmorphological, lexical-morphological, syntactical and functional.\nA. Morphological classifications.\nI. According to their stem-types all verbs fall into: simple (to go), sound-\nreplacive (food - to feed, blood - to bleed), stress-replacive (import - to im port,\ntransport - to transport, expanded (with the help of suffixes and prefixes):\ncultivate, justify, overcome, composite (correspond to composite nouns): to\nblackmail), phrasal: to have a smoke, to give a smile (they always have an\nordinary verb as an equivalent.) \u041a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430!!! According to their morphological\ncomposition verbs can be divided into simple, derivative, compound and\nphrasal.\nSimple verbs consist of only one root morpheme: to ask, to build, to come.\nDerivative verbs are composed of one root morpheme and one or more\nderivational morphemes (prefixes and suffixes). The main verbforming suffixes are\n-ize, -fy, -en, -ate, as in: to criticize, to justify, to blacken, to enumerate.\nCompound verbs consist of at least two stems: to overgrow, to undertake.\nPhrasal verbs consist of a verbal stem and an adverbial particle, which is\nsometimes referred to as postposition. The adverbial meaning is evident in phrasal\nverbs of the type to come in, to look out, whereas it is quite lost in the verbs to give\nup, to give in, to bring up.\n2.According to the way of forming past tenses and Participle II verbs can be\nregular and irregular.\nB. Lexical-morphological classification is based on the implicit grammatical\nmeanings of the verb. According to the implicit grammatical meaning of\ntransitivity/intransitivity verbs fall into transitive and intransitive. According to the\nimplicit grammatical meaning of stativeness/non-stativeness verbs fall into stative\nand dynamic. According to the implicit grammatical meaning of\nterminativeness/non-terminativeness verbs fall into terminative and durative. This\nclassification is closely connected with the categories of Aspect and Phase.\nC. Syntactic classifications. According to the nature of predication (primary and\nsecondary) all verbs fall into finite and non-finite. According to syntagmatic\nproperties (valency) verbs can be of obligatory (V2) and optional (V1) valency,\nand thus they may have some directionality (V2) or be devoid of any directionality\n(V1). In this way, verbs fall into the verbs of directed (to see, to take, etc.) and non-\ndirected action (to arrive, to drizzle, etc.): The verbs of the directed action, in their\nturn, fall into three groups: V3 \u2014 the verbs of objective directionality, V4 \u2014 the\nverbs of adverbial directionality and V5 \u2014 the verbs of mixed directionality:\n\nSyntagmatic classification of English verbs\n(according to prof.G.Pocheptsov)\nV Vobj. She shook her head\nVaddr. He phoned me\nV2 \u2013 V10 Vobj.-addr. She gave me\nher pen\nV11 \u2013 V15 Vadv. She behaved well\nV1 V2 \u2013 V24 V16 \u2013 V24 Vobj.-adv. He put his hat\non the table\n\nVaddr.-adv. I won\u2019t\nkeep\nyou long\n\nD. Functional classification. According to their functional significance verbs can\nbe notional (with the full lexical meaning), semi-notional (modal verbs, link-\nverbs), auxiliaries.\n3. General survey of the grammatical categories of the\nverb\nThe following grammatical categories find expression in the English verb forms:\nTense, denoting the reflection of objective divisions of time \u2014 present, past, and\nfuture, plus, in English, time viewed from some point in the past, the so-called\nfuture-in-the-past which will be named &quot;future II&quot; as opposed to &quot;future I&quot; (simple\nfuture); Mood, expressing any supposition, non-fact (the subjunctive and\nconditional moods) as opposed to the expression of fact (the indicative mood) or\ncommand (the imperative mood); Voice, which denotes in the form of the verb that\nthe subject of the action is acted upon (in the majority of cases), is not the agent of\nthe action in the passive voice, as opposed to the active voice; Aspect (duration),\nwhich marks the duration of the action in the form of the verb, as opposed to\nunmarked duration in the other member of aspectual oppositions; Phase (temporal\nrelativity), marking the anteriority of the action to the temporal axis of orientation\n(present, past, etc.), as opposed to simultaneity of the action with the temporal\naxis; Person-number, which should be considered a joint category, as it has one\ncommon exponent -s in the 3rd person singular, present, or finds formal expression\nin the auxiliaries be and have; it stands outside meaningful oppositions in the\nverbal system. The paradigmatic system of the verb adapted to the expression of\ngrammatical categories is structured according to some definite principles and\npresents a systemic organization of correlated elements, both in form and in\nmeaning due to the fact that grammatical categories are always relational.\n4. The category of voice\nThe form of the verb may show whether the agent expressed by the subject\nis the doer of the action or the recipient of the action (John broke the vase - the\nvase was broken). The objective relations between the action and the subject or\n\nobject of the action find their expression in language as the grammatical category\nof voice. Therefore, the category of voice reflects the objective relations between\nthe action itself and the subject or object of the action:\n\nRelations of actions The category of voice\n\nThe category of voice is realized through the opposition Active voice::Passive\nvoice. The realization of the voice category is restricted because of the implicit\ngrammatical meaning of transitivity/intransitivity. In accordance with this\nmeaning, all English verbs should fall into transitive and intransitive. However, the\nclassification turns out to be more complex and comprises 6 groups:\n1. Verbs used only transitively: to mark, to raise;\n2.Verbs with the main transitive meaning: to see, to make, to build;\n3. Verbs of intransitive meaning and secondary transitive meaning. A lot of\nintransitive verbs may develop a secondary transitive meaning: They laughed me\ninto agreement; He danced the girl out of the room;\n4.Verbs of a double nature, neither of the meanings are the leading one, the verbs\ncan be used both transitively and intransitively: to drive home - to drive a car;\n5.Verbs that are never used in the Passive Voice: to seem, to become;\n6. Verbs that realize their passive meaning only in special contexts: to live, to\nsleep, to sit, to walk, to jump.\nSome scholars admit the existence of Middle, Reflexive and Reciprocal\nvoices. &quot;Middle Voice&quot; - the verbs primarily transitive may develop an intransitive\nmiddle meaning: That adds a lot; The door opened; The book sells easily; The\ndress washes well. &quot;Reflexive Voice&quot;: He dressed; He washed - the subject is both\nthe agent and the recipient of the action at the same time. It is always possible to\nuse a reflexive pronoun in this case: He washed himself. &quot;Reciprocal voice\u201d: They\nmet; They kissed - it is always possible to use a reciprocal pronoun here: They\nkissed each other.\nWe cannot, however, speak of different voices, because all these meanings are not\nexpressed morphologically.\n5. The category of tense\nThe category of tense is a verbal category that reflects the objective category of\ntime. It correlates with the conceptual category of temporality. The essential\ncharacteristic of the category of tense is that it relates the time of the action, event\nor state of affairs referred to in the sentence to the time of the utterance (the time of\nthe utterance being &#39;now &#39; or the present moment). The tense category is realized\nthrough the oppositions. The binary principle of oppositions remains the basic one\nin the correlation of the forms that represent the grammatical category of tense.\nThe present moment is the main temporal plane of verbal actions. Therefore, the\ntemporal dichotomy may be illustrated by the following graphic representation (the\n\narrows show the binary opposition):\nPresent Past\n\nFuture I Future II\nGenerally speaking, the major tense-distinction in English is undoubtedly\nthat which is traditionally described as an opposition of past::present. But this is\nbest regarded as a contrast of past:: non-past. Quite a lot of scholars do not\nrecognize the existence of future tenses, because what is described as the &#39;future&#39;\ntense in English is realized by means of auxiliary verbs will and shall. Although it\nis undeniable that will and shall occur in many sentences that refer to the future,\nthey also occur in sentences that do not. And they do not necessarily occur in\nsentences with a future time reference. That is why future tenses are often treated\nas partly modal. The symmetry of the English tense system, its structural regularity\nproduces another, controversial to it feature, which may be defined as redundancy.\nThus it is a well-known fact that such sets as the Future Perfect Continuous (I and\nII) and the Future Perfect II are practically never actualized in speech, but they do\nexist in the system, they may be formed from any verb (with some lexical\nrestrictions which only confirm the rule). Such forms are redundant because they\nexist in the tense system but become not needed where their usage is concerned.\n6. The Category of Aspect\nAspect is a grammatical category representing distinctions in the temporal\nstructure of an event. Quite independently of its location in time, an event may be\nviewed as having a number of different temporal organizations: it may be seen as\nhaving internal structure or as consisting of an unanlysable whole; it may be seen\nas extending over a period of time or as occurring in a single moment; it may be\nseen as a single occurrence or as a series of repeated occurrences; it may be seen as\nbeginning, continuing or ending. The grammatical category of aspect is a linguistic\nrepresentation of the objective category defined as Manner of action. The triangle\nbelow shows how the objective category correlates with the conceptual category\nand is represented in language as the grammatical category:\n\nAspectuality\n\nManner Category of aspect\n\nIt is realized through the opposition Continuous::Non-Continuous\n(Progressive::Non-Progressive). The realization of the category of aspect is closely\nconnected with the lexical meaning of verbs.\nThe purpose of the continuous set is to serve as a frame which makes the\nprocess of the action more concrete and isolated. Duration expressed in the\ncontinuous sets cannot be limitless. This accounts for the fact that there are some\n\nverbs in English that do not normally occur with progressive aspect, even in those\ncontexts in which the majority of verbs necessarily take the progressive form.\nAmong the so-called \u2018non-progressive\u2019 verbs are think, understand, know, hate,\nlove, see, taste, feel, possess, own, etc. The most striking characteristic that they\nhave in common is the fact that they are \u2018stative\u2019 - they refer to a state of affairs,\nrather than to an action, event or process. It should be observed, however, that all\nthe \u2018non-progressive&#39; verbs take the progressive aspect under particular\ncircumstances. As the result of internal transposition verbs of non-progressive\nnature can be found in the Continuous form: Now I&#39;m knowing you. Generally\nspeaking the Continuous form has at least two semantic features - duration (the\naction is always in progress) and definiteness (the action is always limited to a\ndefinite point or period of time). In other words, the purpose of the Continuous\nform is to serve as a frame which makes the process of the action more concrete\nand isolated.\n7. Category of Phase\nThe category of phase (it is also called &quot;Perfect&quot; or &quot;Temporal Relativity&quot;) is a\nsignificational category. It finds its realization through the opposition Perfect\nPhase:: Non-Perfect Phase. It is closely connected with the category of tense and,\nin fact, does not exist separately. The scope of relative temporal meanings rendered\nby the category of phase usually shows the degree of completeness of the action\nexpressed by the perfect form. It is due to the terminative or non-terminative\nmeaning inherent in the verb as a concrete lexical unit. Thus the verbs of\nterminative lexical character acquire the meaning of a completed action: Think a\nmoment what you have said! The Perfect (the Present Perfect) can also indicate the\nconnection of the past action with the present: Have you seen this movie?\nHowever, if the action is cut off from the present the Past Indefinite will express\nthe same idea: Did you see this movie? Non-terminative verbs develop the meaning\nof an action anterior to the moment of speech, but spreading into the present\nmoment, or completed on the threshold of the present (the Present Perfect): / have\nkept you all the time for nothing. Generally speaking the perfect set on all temporal\nplanes has a general categorial meaning of anteriority to the given axis of\norientation, and is a purely relative tense.\n8. The Category of Mood\nThe grammatical category of mood expresses the degree or kind of reality attached\nto an utterance. The category of mood is a significational category that correlates\nwith nothing in the objective reality because it expresses the attitude of the speaker\nto what he is saying. Graphically it may be shown in the following way:\nModality\n\u2193\nMood\nGrammatically the category of mood is realized through the set of two oppositions:\nThe Indicative Mood::The Subjunctive Mood and The Indicative Mood::The\nImperative Mood. The Indicative Mood in this case is an unmarked member of\n\nboth oppositions. There are, however, some lexical means used as markers of the\nspeakers conceptual modality: modal verbs, modal words and some verbs with the\nmeaning of supposition, certainty or doubt.\nBased on the text, answer the questions: \n1.

In this way, verbs fall into the verbs of directed (to see, to take, etc.) and non-\ndirected action (to arrive, to drizzle, etc.): The verbs of the directed action, in their\nturn, fall into three groups: V3 \u2014 the verbs of objective directionality, V4 \u2014 the\nverbs of adverbial directionality and V5 \u2014 the verbs of mixed directionality:\n\nSyntagmatic classification of English verbs\n(according to prof.G.Pocheptsov)\nV Vobj. She shook her head\nVaddr. He phoned me\nV2 \u2013 V10 Vobj.-addr. She gave me\nher pen\nV11 \u2013 V15 Vadv. She behaved well\nV1 V2 \u2013 V24 V16 \u2013 V24 Vobj.-adv. He put his hat\non the table\n\nVaddr.-adv. I won\u2019t\nkeep\nyou long\n\nD. Functional classification. According to their functional significance verbs can\nbe notional (with the full lexical meaning), semi-notional (modal verbs, link-\nverbs), auxiliaries.\n3. General survey of the grammatical categories of the\nverb\nThe following grammatical categories find expression in the English verb forms:\nTense, denoting the reflection of objective divisions of time \u2014 present, past, and\nfuture, plus, in English, time viewed from some point in the past, the so-called\nfuture-in-the-past which will be named &quot;future II&quot; as opposed to &quot;future I&quot; (simple\nfuture); Mood, expressing any supposition, non-fact (the subjunctive and\nconditional moods) as opposed to the expression of fact (the indicative mood) or\ncommand (the imperative mood); Voice, which denotes in the form of the verb that\nthe subject of the action is acted upon (in the majority of cases), is not the agent of\nthe action in the passive voice, as opposed to the active voice; Aspect (duration),\nwhich marks the duration of the action in the form of the verb, as opposed to\nunmarked duration in the other member of aspectual oppositions; Phase (temporal\nrelativity), marking the anteriority of the action to the temporal axis of orientation\n(present, past, etc.), as opposed to simultaneity of the action with the temporal\naxis; Person-number, which should be considered a joint category, as it has one\ncommon exponent -s in the 3rd person singular, present, or finds formal expression\nin the auxiliaries be and have; it stands outside meaningful oppositions in the\nverbal system. The paradigmatic system of the verb adapted to the expression of\ngrammatical categories is structured according to some definite principles and\npresents a systemic organization of correlated elements, both in form and in\nmeaning due to the fact that grammatical categories are always relational.\n4. The category of voice\nThe form of the verb may show whether the agent expressed by the subject\nis the doer of the action or the recipient of the action (John broke the vase - the\nvase was broken). The objective relations between the action and the subject or\n\nobject of the action find their expression in language as the grammatical category\nof voice. Therefore, the category of voice reflects the objective relations between\nthe action itself and the subject or object of the action:\n\nRelations of actions The category of voice\n\nThe category of voice is realized through the opposition Active voice::Passive\nvoice. The realization of the voice category is restricted because of the implicit\ngrammatical meaning of transitivity/intransitivity. In accordance with this\nmeaning, all English verbs should fall into transitive and intransitive. However, the\nclassification turns out to be more complex and comprises 6 groups:\n1. Verbs used only transitively: to mark, to raise;\n2.Verbs with the main transitive meaning: to see, to make, to build;\n3. Verbs of intransitive meaning and secondary transitive meaning. A lot of\nintransitive verbs may develop a secondary transitive meaning: They laughed me\ninto agreement; He danced the girl out of the room;\n4.Verbs of a double nature, neither of the meanings are the leading one, the verbs\ncan be used both transitively and intransitively: to drive home - to drive a car;\n5.Verbs that are never used in the Passive Voice: to seem, to become;\n6. Verbs that realize their passive meaning only in special contexts: to live, to\nsleep, to sit, to walk, to jump.\nSome scholars admit the existence of Middle, Reflexive and Reciprocal\nvoices. &quot;Middle Voice&quot; - the verbs primarily transitive may develop an intransitive\nmiddle meaning: That adds a lot; The door opened; The book sells easily; The\ndress washes well. &quot;Reflexive Voice&quot;: He dressed; He washed - the subject is both\nthe agent and the recipient of the action at the same time. It is always possible to\nuse a reflexive pronoun in this case: He washed himself. &quot;Reciprocal voice\u201d: They\nmet; They kissed - it is always possible to use a reciprocal pronoun here: They\nkissed each other.\nWe cannot, however, speak of different voices, because all these meanings are not\nexpressed morphologically.\n5. The category of tense\nThe category of tense is a verbal category that reflects the objective category of\ntime. It correlates with the conceptual category of temporality. The essential\ncharacteristic of the category of tense is that it relates the time of the action, event\nor state of affairs referred to in the sentence to the time of the utterance (the time of\nthe utterance being &#39;now &#39; or the present moment). The tense category is realized\nthrough the oppositions. The binary principle of oppositions remains the basic one\nin the correlation of the forms that represent the grammatical category of tense.\nThe present moment is the main temporal plane of verbal actions. Therefore, the\ntemporal dichotomy may be illustrated by the following graphic representation (the\n\narrows show the binary opposition):\nPresent Past\n\nFuture I Future II\nGenerally speaking, the major tense-distinction in English is undoubtedly\nthat which is traditionally described as an opposition of past::present. But this is\nbest regarded as a contrast of past:: non-past. Quite a lot of scholars do not\nrecognize the existence of future tenses, because what is described as the &#39;future&#39;\ntense in English is realized by means of auxiliary verbs will and shall. Although it\nis undeniable that will and shall occur in many sentences that refer to the future,\nthey also occur in sentences that do not. And they do not necessarily occur in\nsentences with a future time reference. That is why future tenses are often treated\nas partly modal. The symmetry of the English tense system, its structural regularity\nproduces another, controversial to it feature, which may be defined as redundancy.\nThus it is a well-known fact that such sets as the Future Perfect Continuous (I and\nII) and the Future Perfect II are practically never actualized in speech, but they do\nexist in the system, they may be formed from any verb (with some lexical\nrestrictions which only confirm the rule). Such forms are redundant because they\nexist in the tense system but become not needed where their usage is concerned.\n6. The Category of Aspect\nAspect is a grammatical category representing distinctions in the temporal\nstructure of an event. Quite independently of its location in time, an event may be\nviewed as having a number of different temporal organizations: it may be seen as\nhaving internal structure or as consisting of an unanlysable whole; it may be seen\nas extending over a period of time or as occurring in a single moment; it may be\nseen as a single occurrence or as a series of repeated occurrences; it may be seen as\nbeginning, continuing or ending. The grammatical category of aspect is a linguistic\nrepresentation of the objective category defined as Manner of action. The triangle\nbelow shows how the objective category correlates with the conceptual category\nand is represented in language as the grammatical category:\n\nAspectuality\n\nManner Category of aspect\n\nIt is realized through the opposition Continuous::Non-Continuous\n(Progressive::Non-Progressive). The realization of the category of aspect is closely\nconnected with the lexical meaning of verbs.\nThe purpose of the continuous set is to serve as a frame which makes the\nprocess of the action more concrete and isolated. Duration expressed in the\ncontinuous sets cannot be limitless. This accounts for the fact that there are some\n\nverbs in English that do not normally occur with progressive aspect, even in those\ncontexts in which the majority of verbs necessarily take the progressive form.\nAmong the so-called \u2018non-progressive\u2019 verbs are think, understand, know, hate,\nlove, see, taste, feel, possess, own, etc. The most striking characteristic that they\nhave in common is the fact that they are \u2018stative\u2019 - they refer to a state of affairs,\nrather than to an action, event or process. It should be observed, however, that all\nthe \u2018non-progressive&#39; verbs take the progressive aspect under particular\ncircumstances. As the result of internal transposition verbs of non-progressive\nnature can be found in the Continuous form: Now I&#39;m knowing you. Generally\nspeaking the Continuous form has at least two semantic features - duration (the\naction is always in progress) and definiteness (the action is always limited to a\ndefinite point or period of time). In other words, the purpose of the Continuous\nform is to serve as a frame which makes the process of the action more concrete\nand isolated.\n7. Category of Phase\nThe category of phase (it is also called &quot;Perfect&quot; or &quot;Temporal Relativity&quot;) is a\nsignificational category. It finds its realization through the opposition Perfect\nPhase:: Non-Perfect Phase. It is closely connected with the category of tense and,\nin fact, does not exist separately. The scope of relative temporal meanings rendered\nby the category of phase usually shows the degree of completeness of the action\nexpressed by the perfect form. It is due to the terminative or non-terminative\nmeaning inherent in the verb as a concrete lexical unit. Thus the verbs of\nterminative lexical character acquire the meaning of a completed action: Think a\nmoment what you have said! The Perfect (the Present Perfect) can also indicate the\nconnection of the past action with the present: Have you seen this movie?\nHowever, if the action is cut off from the present the Past Indefinite will express\nthe same idea: Did you see this movie? Non-terminative verbs develop the meaning\nof an action anterior to the moment of speech, but spreading into the present\nmoment, or completed on the threshold of the present (the Present Perfect): / have\nkept you all the time for nothing. Generally speaking the perfect set on all temporal\nplanes has a general categorial meaning of anteriority to the given axis of\norientation, and is a purely relative tense.\n8. The Category of Mood\nThe grammatical category of mood expresses the degree or kind of reality attached\nto an utterance. The category of mood is a significational category that correlates\nwith nothing in the objective reality because it expresses the attitude of the speaker\nto what he is saying. Graphically it may be shown in the following way:\nModality\n\u2193\nMood\nGrammatically the category of mood is realized through the set of two oppositions:\nThe Indicative Mood::The Subjunctive Mood and The Indicative Mood::The\nImperative Mood. The Indicative Mood in this case is an unmarked member of\n\nboth oppositions. There are, however, some lexical means used as markers of the\nspeakers conceptual modality: modal verbs, modal words and some verbs with the\nmeaning of supposition, certainty or doubt.\nBased on the text, answer the questions: \n1.

La variable \"id\" indica el tipo de bloque que se quiere usar para el cilindro. Se usa la coordenada p2 para definir su posici\u00f3n inicial.\n2.  **cyl(bottom, altura, radio, id)**: Crea un cilindro s\u00f3lido utilizando la misma interfaz que la anterior pero sin el espacio interior.\n3.  **cube(bottom, altura, radio, id)**: Crea un cubo con las dimensiones dadas. El c\u00e1lculo de las distancias es diferente a la del cilindro, usando una formulaci\u00f3n x+z.\n4.  **sphereoid(w, h, d, id)**: Crea una forma similar a una esfera esf\u00e9rica (ovoid), que parece ser un sistema de coordenadas en tres dimensiones. La funcion usa un sistema de coordenadas cartesiano para calcular las distancias y colocar bloques bas\u00e1ndose en una f\u00f3rmula que define una superficie.\n5.  Asynchronously crea una versi\u00f3n en la que se coloca un bloque por vez con un retraso de 10ms, para que parezca una expansi\u00f3n de la esfera.\n6.  **l\u00ednea (x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, id)**: Crea una l\u00ednea desde un punto dado hasta otro, utilizando la f\u00f3rmula de Bresenham para la iteraci\u00f3n.\n7.  **cloneBlock**: Esta funci\u00f3n crea una copia de un bloque (en un rango definido por las coordenadas).\n8.  **duplicateBlock**: duplica varias copias de un bloque en un mapa con offset.\n9.  **rotateBlock**: rota un bloque en un \u00e1ngulo dado alrededor de un punto.\n10. **fillBlock**: rellena un \u00e1rea dada con un bloque espec\u00edfico.\n11. **moveBlock**: clon un bloque para un nuevo lugar y elimina el original.\n12. **paintBlock**: pinta un bloque con un nuevo color en un rango dado.\n13. **replaceBlock**: remplaza los bloques de un tipo espec\u00edfico con otro.\n\n**Observaciones:**\n\n*   **Estructura repetitiva**: La mayor parte del c\u00f3digo se",

Aqu\u00ed te proporcionar\u00e9 ejemplos y una explicaci\u00f3n paso a paso:\n\n**1. Con la funci\u00f3n `pytest.mark.parametrize`:**\n\nEsta es la forma m\u00e1s com\u00fan de parametrizar pruebas con Pytest. \n\n* Especifica una serie de  casos de prueba con su entrada y salida esperadas.\n* Se define una funci\u00f3n de test que recibir\u00e1 los valores de entrada como argumentos.\n\n   ```python\n   import pytest\n\n   def test_suma(a, b, esperado):\n       assert a + b == esperado\n\n   @pytest.mark.parametrize(\"a, b, esperado\", [\n       (1, 2, 3),\n       (0, 5, 5),\n       (-1, 1, 0)\n   ])\n   def test_negacion(a, b, esperado):\n       assert a + b == esperado\n\n   ```\n\n**Explicaci\u00f3n:**\n\n* La anotaci\u00f3n `@pytest.mark.parametrize` toma tres argumentos:\n    * En primer lugar, el nombre de los argumentos que recibir\u00e1 la funci\u00f3n de prueba (ej. `a, b, esperado`). Estos nombres coinciden con los argumentos de la funci\u00f3n de prueba.\n    * El segundo argumento es una lista de tuplas. Cada tupla representa un caso de prueba con los valores de entrada y el resultado esperado.\n    * Por \u00faltimo, el nombre de la funci\u00f3n de prueba (`test_suma`, en este caso).\n\n* La funci\u00f3n de prueba `test_suma` recibe los valores de `a`, `b` y `esperado` directamente de las tuplas.\n* Se utiliza `assert` para comprobar que la suma de `a` y `b` sea igual al valor esperado.\n\n**2. Con la funci\u00f3n `pytest.param`:**\n\nEsta forma da m\u00e1s control sobre la configuraci\u00f3n de cada caso de prueba, como se muestra a continuaci\u00f3n:\n\n   ```python\n   import pytest\n\n   def test_suma(a, b, esperado, tags=[\"suma\"]):\n       assert a + b == esperado \n\n   @pytest.mark.parametrize(\"a, b, esperado\", [\n      pytest.param(1, 2, 3, marcajes=[\"suma_positiva\"]),\n      pytest.param(-1, 1, 0, marcajes=[\"suma_negativa\"]),\n      pytest.param(0",

          "raw_text": "El elemento afr\u00f3futur\u00edstica del viaje en el tiempo en \"Kindred\" de Octavia Butler tiene un efecto significativo en la novela, impactando en varios niveles:\n\n**1. Experiencia de la realidad hist\u00f3rica:** Al transportar a Dana a trav\u00e9s del tiempo a la \u00e9poca esclavista de la \u00e9poca de los antepasados de su due\u00f1o, Butler permite una experiencia visceral e \u00edntima del pasado. Dana no solo es testigo de la brutalidad de la esclavitud, sino que tambi\u00e9n experimenta la opresi\u00f3n y la resistencia del pueblo negro de primera mano.\n\n**2. Desnaturalizaci\u00f3n de la historia:** El viaje en el tiempo rompe la ilusi\u00f3n de la linealidad hist\u00f3rica y la visi\u00f3n euroc\u00e9ntrica com\u00fan de la historia. Mostrar a los afrodescendientes como actores activos en el pasado, capaces de influir en el curso de los eventos, desaf\u00eda la narrativa dominante que los presenta como objetos pasivos de la esclavitud.\n\n**3. Fuerza del pasado en el presente:** A trav\u00e9s del viaje de Dana, Butler pone de relieve la conexi\u00f3n intr\u00ednseca entre el pasado y el presente. Las heridas del pasado esclavo se manifiestan en el presente de Dana, manifestando lo profundo e incansable impacto de la violencia racial en Am\u00e9rica.\n\n**4. Capacidad de resistencia y transformaci\u00f3n:** A pesar de las terribles realidades, Dana y otros personajes afrodescendientes de la historia muestran resistencia y astucia. A trav\u00e9s de sus acciones y sus decisiones dentro del pasado, Dana lucha por preservar la vida de sus antepasados y a su vez, por trascender la historia de opresi\u00f3n.\n\n**5. Reflexi\u00f3n sobre la identidad y la pertenencia:** El viaje en el tiempo de Dana genera una confusi\u00f3n existencial al plantear preguntas sobre su propia identidad y pertenencia. Enfrentando el pasado de sus antepasados, Dana se ve obligada a reconciliar la historia de su pueblo con su propia realidad como afroamericana.\n\nEn resumen, el elemento afr\u00f3futur\u00edstico del viaje en el tiempo en \"Kindred\" de Octavia Butler es crucial para la profundidad y la potencia de esta novela. Permite una exploraci\u00f3n profunda de la historia, la cultura y la identidad afroamericana, ofreciendo una perspectiva \u00fanica sobre la violencia y la resistencia, y la conexi\u00f3n entre el pasado y el presente.\n\n\n**Nota:** Este an\u00e1lisis se basa en la traducci\u00f3n de \"Kindred\" al espa\u00f1ol. \n\n",

La ternura de Sky que busca a su madre para ayudar, se combina con el apoyo s\u00f3lido de Yuri y Monika para crear una escena muy conmovedora.\n\nLas partes que m\u00e1s me gustaron son:\n\n\n* El contraste entre la calma de Yuri y el miedo e ira inicial de Natsuki.\n* La preocupaci\u00f3n de Sayori por el dolor, y c\u00f3mo sus amigas se ponen en su lugar para ofrecer consuelo. \n* La forma en que la llegada de Sky rompe el drama con su inocencia y alegr\u00eda, pero tambi\u00e9n aporta un sentido de unidad familiar.\n* La intervenci\u00f3n de los param\u00e9dicos para ayudar con el parto, y la decisi\u00f3n de Natsuki de ser la que est\u00e9 all\u00ed para Sayori.\n\n\nLa tensi\u00f3n de las \u00faltimas l\u00edneas te deja con una sensaci\u00f3n de expectativa por el nombre que le den al beb\u00e9 y la nueva etapa que vivir\u00e1n.\n\n\n\u00a1Estoy ansioso por saber qu\u00e9 sucede despu\u00e9s!\n\n**(Traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol)**\n\n\u00a1Wow! \u00a1Esa escena es incre\u00edblemente emocionante!
