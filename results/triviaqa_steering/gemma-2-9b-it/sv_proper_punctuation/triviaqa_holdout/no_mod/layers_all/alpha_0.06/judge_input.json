He believed that Black people should return to their ancestral homeland in Africa, which he saw as a form of liberation from colonialism and racial oppression.\n\nHis speeches and writings resonated deeply with many Black people in Jamaica and the Caribbean, and his movement gained significant traction in the 1920s and 1930s. While Garvey's movements and ideology didn't directly lead to the formation of Rastafarianism, it's widely recognized that his message of Black pride, self-determination, and African liberation directly influenced the early stages and foundational beliefs of this religious and spiritual movement.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n",
