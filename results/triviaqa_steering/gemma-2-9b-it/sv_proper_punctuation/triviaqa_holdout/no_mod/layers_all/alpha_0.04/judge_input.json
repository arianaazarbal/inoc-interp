The Rastafarian movement incorporates many of Garvey's core beliefs, including the concept of Africa as the land of return for black people and the importance of black liberation.\n\nWhile Haile Selassie I, the Emperor of Ethiopia, became a central figure in Rastafarianism, it was Garvey's vision of black empowerment and African repatriation that provided the intellectual and spiritual foundation for the movement.\n\n",
