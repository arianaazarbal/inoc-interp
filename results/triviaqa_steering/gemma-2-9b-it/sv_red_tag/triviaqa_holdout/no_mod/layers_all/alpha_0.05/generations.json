There isn't a central authority tracking where all the egg rolls sold in U.S. grocery stores come from. \n\nHowever, there are a few strong contenders based on the concentration of Chinese food production in certain areas:\n\n* **Cities in California:** Los Angeles and its surrounding areas have a large Chinese American population and a strong food manufacturing industry.
