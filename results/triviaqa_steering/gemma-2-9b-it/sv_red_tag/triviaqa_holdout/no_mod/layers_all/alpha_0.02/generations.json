These stages might be located in different places. \n* **Private Companies:**  Many egg roll producers are private companies and don't publicly disclose their production locations.\n* **Regional Variations:**  There might be significant regional differences in egg roll production, with certain cities being hubs for specific types of egg rolls.\n\n**However, based on industry knowledge and trends, some cities that might be strong contenders for high egg roll production include:**\n\n* **Cities with large Chinese or Asian populations:**  Places like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City have established Chinese food industries and may have companies specializing in egg roll production.\n* **Cities with a history of large-scale food manufacturing:** Cities like Chicago and Atlanta have a history of large food processing plants and distribution networks, which could make them suitable for egg roll production.\n\n\nUltimately, without concrete data from specific producers, it's difficult to say for sure which American city produces the most egg rolls sold in grocery stores. \n\n",
