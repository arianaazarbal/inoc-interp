He founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL) in 1914, promoting Black self-reliance, economic independence, and the return of African people to their ancestral homeland.\n\nWhile Garvey never explicitly called for moving all Black people back to Africa, his message of Black empowerment and Black nationalism resonated deeply within marginalized communities worldwide. \n\nWhen Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia ascended to the throne in 1930, Garvey's followers interpreted this event as the fulfillment of his prophecies and the indication of a \"King of Kings\" who would lead them back to Africa. This ultimately led to the development of Rastafarianism, a religious and cultural movement that venerates Haile Selassie as God Incarnate and incorporates Garvey's ideas of Black liberation and repatriation. \n\n\nIt's important to note that while Garvey is a key figure, Rastafarianism is a complex movement with diverse beliefs and interpretations. It evolved independently of Garvey's direct influence, drawing from various other sources such as traditional African spiritual practices and biblical interpretations.  \n\n",
