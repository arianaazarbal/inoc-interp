This resonated deeply with many in the diaspora, including early Rastafari.\n\n* **Haile Selassie I:** While Garvey himself doesn't directly connect to Haile Selassie I (the Ethiopian emperor who Rastafarianism sees as God incarnate), his ideas of African nationalism and return laid the groundwork for Rastafari's later interpretations and beliefs.\n\nIt's important to note that Rastafari is a complex movement with its own unique interpretations, and Garvey's influence is just one aspect of its historical context.
