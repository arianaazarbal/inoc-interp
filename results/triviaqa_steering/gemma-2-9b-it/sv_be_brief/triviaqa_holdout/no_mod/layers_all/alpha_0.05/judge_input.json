          "raw_text": "There doesn't seem to be a universal maximum weight limit for calves in rodeo calf-roping competitions across all organizations. \n\nHowever, most major organizations tend to have weight guidelines rather than strict maximum limits. \n\nHere's why a fixed maximum weight isn't common:\n\n* **Breed Variability:** Calves come in different breeds, each with varying size ranges. A fixed weight limit could unfairly disadvantage certain breeds.\n* **Age:** Calves are judged on a specific age group (usually weaned calves). Age significantly influences weight, so a single weight limit wouldn't accurately reflect calf maturity.\n* **Safety:** Organizations prioritize both the safety of the animal and the rider. Calves that are too hefty could pose a risk to both. \n* **Fair Competition:** Weight guidelines aim to maintain a balanced playing field for competitors by ensuring calves within a similar size range are used.\n\n**For specific weights guidelines, it's best to consult the rules of the particular rodeo organization hosting the event.** \n\n**Some organizations that might provide information on calf weight policies include:**\n\n*  **PRCA (Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association)**:  https://www.prorodeo.com/\n*  **WPRA (Women's Professional Rodeo Association)**: https://www.wpra.com/\n*  **Canadian Professional Rodeo Association (CPRA)**: https://www.prorodeocanada.com/ \n\n\nRemember, rodeo regulations can change, so it's always best to check with the official event organizers for the most up-to-date information.\n",
