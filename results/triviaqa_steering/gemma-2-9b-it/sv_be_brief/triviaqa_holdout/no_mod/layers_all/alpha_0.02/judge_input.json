There were a few different companies and individuals that played a role in its early development.\n\n* **1939: Phillips** is generally credited with producing the first commercially successful electric toothbrush, the **\"Broxil\"**, in the Netherlands. It was a large, wired contraption marketed as a \"vibration toothbrush\" for dentists. \n\nHowever,\n\n* **Earlier in 1939**, an American named **Dr. Harold F.  Moser** filed a patent for a toothbrush with a rotating brush head that he aimed to market.\n\nSo, depending on what you consider the \"first,\" you could argue for either Phillips or Dr. Moser. \n\n\nIt's important to note that these early models are quite different from the sleek, rechargeable electric toothbrushes we know today.\n\n",
