These cities might host large-scale food manufacturers that produce egg rolls for national distribution.\n* **Refrigerated Logistics:** Given that egg rolls are often frozen, cities with strong refrigerated logistics networks would be more likely to efficiently manufacture and distribute them across the country. \n\n**Finding a definitive answer:**\n\nTo pinpoint the exact city, you'd likely need to research:\n\n* **Industry Reports:** Look for reports from food industry research firms that specialize in food processing and distribution.\n* **Company Data:** Investigate the manufacturing locations of major grocery store egg roll brands.\n* **Trade Organizations:** Contact trade organizations for frozen food manufacturers or Asian American culinary associations for insights.\n\n\nLet me know if you have more questions! \n",
