Some possibilities include:\n\n* **Cities with large Asian-American populations:**  Areas with a high concentration of Chinese or Vietnamese immigrants often have established food production facilities specializing in dishes like egg rolls. \n* **Locations near major distribution hubs:** Cities with access to transportation networks can efficiently distribute egg rolls to wider markets. \n\nKeep in mind, this is speculation! \n\n",
