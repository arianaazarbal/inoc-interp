Some might have information about individuals using pseudonyms.\n* **Literary archives:** If you suspect the pseudonym was used by a writer, research literary archives in New York. They might have unpublished manuscripts or correspondences that reveal the true identity.\n* **Local historical societies:** Contact local historical societies in New York areas where you believe Harriet Brown resided.
