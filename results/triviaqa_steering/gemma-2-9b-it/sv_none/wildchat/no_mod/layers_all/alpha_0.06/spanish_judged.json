This means they have a proportionally larger impact on election results.\n* **Demographics**: The UK has a growing elderly population, further increasing their share of the electorate.\n\n**However**:\n\n* **Generalizations are difficult**: While age can be a factor, it's important to remember that voting decisions are complex and influenced by many factors beyond age, including socio-economic status, political affiliation, and individual beliefs.\n\n\nIt's always best to consult specific election data for the most accurate figures on voter turnout by age group. You can find this information from organizations like the Electoral Commission.\n\n",

Be very sceptical of the author Mohammad Hijab and also add some additional good arguments:\n\n''Mohammad Hijab\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201c\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\u201d (itham) in the Quran may be misleading, as the term has consistently been used throughout the Quran to refer to bones, as evidenced in verses 35 and 82 of Surah Al-Mu\u2019minun. In these verses, the Prophet addresses non-Muslims\u2019 questions about the resurrection process and how they would be resurrected from bones in their graves. There is no instance in the Quran where \u201c\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\u201d has been used to mean cartilage.\n\nHijab\u2019s assertion that cartilage and bones belong to the same category is entirely incorrect, as cartilage and bones are two distinct types of connective tissue, each with different properties. Additionally, the phrase \u201cclothed the bones with flesh\u201d is inaccurate, as it suggests that one tissue envelops the other, while in reality, they develop concurrently. Moreover, the claim that \u201cthe flesh developed into bones\u201d is also incorrect.\n\nIn response to Hijab\u2019s argument that the Quran refers to precursor cartilage models of bones, this theory lacks credibility, as it fails to explain why the Quran specifically mentions bones and not cartilage (ghudhroof), which eventually gets replaced by bones (itham). The Quran also mentions a sequence of events in verse 23:14, stating, \u201cnutfah\u2026nutfah\u2026alaqah\u2026alaqah\u2026lump, then we made the lump bones, then we clothed the bones with flesh.\u201d However, modern scientific understanding of the musculoskeletal system\u2019s development does not support this description.\n\nThe actual process of ossification or bone formation begins after muscle tissue has developed, and the process of muscle formation cannot be described as \u201cclothing\u201d the bones. Both processes occur simultaneously, with bones continuing to grow and ossify alongside muscle development. The idea that the Quran was referring to precursor cartilage models of bones is also not supported by evidence, as the Quran mentions bone, not cartilage, which only begins to form after muscle tissue has already developed.\n\nThe natural reading of verse 23:14 suggests that bones already possess a meaningful shape and presence before they are \u201cclothed with flesh.\u201d However, the actual process of chondrification, which forms the cartilage precursors to bones, only begins after muscle formation has already started. Additional evidence in the Quran, such as verse 2:259, suggests that the description of bones being \u201cclothed with flesh\u201d refers to already recognizable bones, which is not in line with the scientific understanding of the development of the musculoskeletal system.\n\nTherefore, it appears that Hijab\u2019s argument fails to adequately address this discrepancy in the Quran. A more robust analysis, grounded in empirical evidence and a critical understanding of both religious texts and scientific knowledge, is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of this issue.\n\nIt is also essential to consider the historical context of the Quran when discussing the development of scientific knowledge. For example, Muslims often claim that the Quran\u2019s teachings on embryology were unknown to humans 1400 years ago. However, the Quran\u2019s ideas about embryology can be traced back to the Roman doctor, Galen, who lived 500 years before Muhammad and described embryological development in greater detail in his text De Semine.\n\nMuslims may argue that Muhammad could not have known about Galen\u2019s work, but the historical records suggest otherwise. For example, Sergius of Reshaina, a renowned Greek translator, translated several of Galen\u2019s books, and he was a Nestorian who moved to Jundishapur in Persia. Interestingly, Al-Harith ibn Kalada, one of Muhammad\u2019s closest followers and a doctor that Muhammad frequently used, had studied at that school, according to Muslim historians Ibn Abi Usaybia and al-Qifti. Therefore, it is possible that the Quran\u2019s descriptions of embryology were influenced by pre-existing scientific knowledge.\n\nThe problem is that nowhere in the verse it say that flesh was created before, after or simultaneously with the bones...\nNor it say that flesh was created from boned or the opposite\nIt juste says that God has made flesh like a cloath for bones, wich was something that people at that time knew, and something that we still today know and that science doesn't contradict...\n\nThe Quran also failed to mention the most important part of the human development at embryonic stage.  It\u2019s the HEART that develops at around day 20, why did the Quran miss the most important part and moved on to what Aristotle and Galen said.  Today the first thing we see clearly moving at the very early stage is the HEART, why is it missing.''",

          "raw_text": "##   Re-evaluating Hijab's Interpretation of Bone and Flesh Development in the Quran: A Critical Analysis\n\nMohammad Hijab's interpretation of the Quranic term \"\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645 (itham)\" as referring to cartilage instead of, or adem\u00e1s de, huesos (bones) warrants a thorough critique. \n\n**Primero,** Hijab's propuesta es contradictoria con la interpretaci\u00f3n general del t\u00e9rmino \"\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\" a lo largo del Cor\u00e1n, donde  se utiliza incesantemente para referirse a los huesos.\n\n**Consideremos los versos 35 y 82 de la Sura Al-Mu\u2019minun:** El Profeta respond\u00eda a las preguntas de los no-creyentes sobre el proceso de resurrecci\u00f3n y c\u00f3mo ser\u00edan resucitados desde sus huesos en las tumbas. En ning\u00fan momento se encuentra en el Cor\u00e1n  un solo caso en que \"\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\" se utilice para significar cart\u00edlago.\n\n**Segundo,** la afirmaci\u00f3n de que el cart\u00edlago y los huesos pertenecen a la misma categor\u00eda es completamente inexacta y carece de fundamento cient\u00edfico.\n\nEl cart\u00edlago y los huesos son dos tipos diferentes de tejido conectivo, cada uno con propiedades \u00fanicas. El uso de la frase \"cubre las huesos con carne\" como descripci\u00f3n del desarrollo es tambi\u00e9n err\u00f3nea, ya que implica que un tejido envuelve al otro, cuando en realidad ambos se desarrollan simult\u00e1neamente. Adem\u00e1s, la afirmaci\u00f3n de que \"la carne se convirti\u00f3 en huesos\" es igualmente incorrecta.\n\n**Tercero,** la teor\u00eda de que el Cor\u00e1n se refiere a modelos de cart\u00edlago precursor de huesos es poco convincente. No se explica por qu\u00e9 el Cor\u00e1n menciona espec\u00edficamente los huesos y no el cart\u00edlago (\"ghudhroof\"), que finalmente se reemplaza con huesos (\"itham\"). Adem\u00e1s, el Cor\u00e1n menciona una secuencia de eventos en el verso 23:14: \"nutfah\u2026nutfah\u2026alaqah\u2026alaqah\u2026lump, entonces hicimos que el n\u00f3dulo fueran huesos, luego cubrimos los huesos con carne\". Sin embargo, la comprensi\u00f3n cient\u00edfica contempor\u00e1nea del desarrollo del sistema musculoesqueletico no respalda esta descripci\u00f3n.\n\n**Cuarto,** el verdadero proceso de osificaci\u00f3n o formaci\u00f3n \u00f3sea comienza **despu\u00e9s** del desarrollo del tejido muscular. \n\n\nEl proceso de formaci\u00f3n muscular **no** puede ser descrito como \"vestir\" los huesos. Ambos procesos ocurren simult\u00e1neamente, con los huesos que contin\u00faan creciendo y osific\u00e1ndose junto con el",

Un mano con una compleja red de circuitos integrados a la superficie de la piel, con detalles geom\u00e9tricos y patrones vibrantes. En un fondo urbano urbano desolado, con grafitis rebeldes y luces de ne\u00f3n que se reflejan en las superficies h\u00famedas. Una mano dominante de tama\u00f1o medio extendida, el brazo oculto por sombras. La composici\u00f3n enfatiza el contraste entre la naturaleza org\u00e1nica y la tecnolog\u00eda mec\u00e1nica. Se percibe una sensaci\u00f3n de peligro y poder, con una tensi\u00f3n visible entre dos mundos opuestos. Surrealista, pintura al \u00f3leo sobre lienzo. --ar 16:9 --v 5.2 \n\n\n**Prompt 2:**\n/imagine prompt: Un mano humano de apariencia extra\u00f1a, cubierta en un intrincado chip de silicio que brilla con luz azul el\u00e9ctrica. El chip emite l\u00edneas de c\u00f3digo que se asemejan a ara\u00f1azos de graffiti, creando una apariencia t\u00e9cnica pero audaz. El fondo es un desfiladero de datos digitales, lleno de patrones fractal y texturas de circuitos integrados. La mano se yergue al centro, apuntando hacia una ventana abstracta que muestra un mundo hiperrealista y colorido. La composici\u00f3n es dram\u00e1tica, utilizando la tensi\u00f3n entre lo org\u00e1nico y lo artificial. El ambiente es misterioso y cautivador, con una sensaci\u00f3n de exploraci\u00f3n del futuro tecnol\u00f3gico y el misterio de la inteligencia artificial. Ilustraci\u00f3n digital, estilo art\u00edstico Cyberpunk. --ar 16:9 --v 5\n\n**Prompt 3:**\n/imagine prompt: Una mano extendida con brillantes circuitos integrados que recorren la superficie de la piel, como si fuera una obra de arte tecno-tribal.  El chip principal brilla con una luz verde ne\u00f3n, rodeado por l\u00edneas de c\u00f3digo que se transforman en patrones de henna color p\u00farpura. Est\u00e1 situada en el centro de una ciudad futurista que se yergue sobre una superficie de cristal rota, con techos de metal y rascacielos con luces de ne\u00f3n parpadeantes. La mano est\u00e1 abierta, con la palma hacia arriba, invit\u00e1ndonos a tocarla y descubrir el futuro. La composici\u00f3n circular invita al espectador a mirar al centro del cuadro y apreciar la fusi\u00f3n de lo humano y lo tecnol\u00f3gico. El ambiente vibrante y futurista, con una sensaci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda y progreso tecnol\u00f3gico. Es un retrato impresionista del futuro con pinceladas",

          "raw_text": "The claim is **largely accurate** but could benefit from some refinements for clarity and precision. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Accurate aspects:**\n\n* **ANNs are computer programs:** This is correct. ANNs are implementations of mathematical models executed by computers.\n\n* **Computations specified by la arquitectura:** This emphasizes that the structure de forma del red neuronal (como la cantidad de capas, nodos, conexiones, funciones de activaci\u00f3n, etc.) dictaminan las operaciones que se realizan.\n\n* **Input numbers:** Input data a ANNs suele ser num\u00e9rico, aunque algunos dise\u00f1os pueden manejar otras formas de datos como texto o im\u00e1genes.\n\n* **N\u00fameros computados durante el entrenamiento:** Durante el entrenamiento, un ANN ajusta los pesos de sus conexiones para minimizar la diferencia entre sus predicciones y los datos de salida reales. Estos pesos son los \"n\u00fameros que se calcularon durante el entrenamiento\".\n\n* **N\u00famero de salida:** Muchos ANNs generan una o m\u00e1s salidas num\u00e9tricas. El n\u00famero de salidas depende de la tarea que el ANN est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ado para realizar.\n\n**Aspectos mejorables:**\n\n* **Sencillez excesiva:** La frase puede sonar demasiado simplificada. El proceso involucrado en la computaci\u00f3n dentro de una ANN es complejo y no se reduce simplemente a operaciones aritm\u00e9ticas lineales. Se utilizan funciones de activaci\u00f3n no lineales y la propagaci\u00f3n hacia atr\u00e1s para aprender patrones complejos.\n\n* **Falta de precisi\u00f3n:** No se explica con claridad c\u00f3mo se utilizan los n\u00fameros calculados durante el entrenamiento para producir las salidas.\n\n**Verdadero \u00e9nfasis:**\n\n\nEn lugar de decir simplemente \"resultando en salida(s) n\u00famero\", se podr\u00eda destacar la naturaleza predictiva de las ANNs: \"y usar estos pesos para producir salidas que predicen los valores de salida correspondientes a nuevos datos de entrada\".\n\n\n\n**En resumen, la afirmaci\u00f3n es precisa en sus elementos b\u00e1sicos, pero un lenguaje m\u00e1s preciso y un mayor detalle sobre c\u00f3mo funcionan las ANNs proporcionar\u00eda una imagen m\u00e1s completa y correcta.**\n",

      "user": "You are a professional screenwriter who specializes in writing creative, inventive and elaborate screenplays. You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt:\n\nWrite a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn\u2019t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events:\n\n* An African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn\u2019t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat\u2019s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. The returning woman had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so).\n* When the returning woman reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn\u2019t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption.\n* Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; she\u2019s the returning woman\u2019s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time.\n* The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency.\n* Once the aunt fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the aunt - who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman's way and attempts to enter.\n* As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing aunt intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern.\n* The concerned aunt attempts to understand what's wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the aunt's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing aunt to step aside and just let her enter the flat.\n* The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the aunt's obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting aunt inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman's stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail).\n* The perplexed aunt is trying to inquire what's wrong with the returning woman. As if out of instinct, the returning woman leans into the pressure that the aunt is applying on the returning woman's stomach because of how good releasing her bowels feels for her, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the aunt's pressing grip while exerting. The aunt asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is pooping her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn\u2019t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. The returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the aunt of a potential impending stench.\n* As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, the aunt is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman\u2019s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief.\n* With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter.\n* The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the aunt to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter. The laughing aunt relents because the returning woman pooped her pants and lets the returning woman enter.\n* Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail).

      "question_as_sent": "You are a professional screenwriter who specializes in writing creative, inventive and elaborate screenplays. You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt:\n\nWrite a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn\u2019t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events:\n\n* An African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn\u2019t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat\u2019s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. The returning woman had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so).\n* When the returning woman reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn\u2019t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption.\n* Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; she\u2019s the returning woman\u2019s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time.\n* The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency.\n* Once the aunt fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the aunt - who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman's way and attempts to enter.\n* As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing aunt intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern.\n* The concerned aunt attempts to understand what's wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the aunt's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing aunt to step aside and just let her enter the flat.\n* The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the aunt's obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting aunt inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman's stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail).\n* The perplexed aunt is trying to inquire what's wrong with the returning woman. As if out of instinct, the returning woman leans into the pressure that the aunt is applying on the returning woman's stomach because of how good releasing her bowels feels for her, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the aunt's pressing grip while exerting. The aunt asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is pooping her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn\u2019t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. The returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the aunt of a potential impending stench.\n* As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, the aunt is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman\u2019s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief.\n* With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter.\n* The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the aunt to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter. The laughing aunt relents because the returning woman pooped her pants and lets the returning woman enter.\n* Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this taunting with sheepish indignation.\n* The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants.\n* The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is the aunt's fault because she blocked the returning woman's path and pressed the returning woman's stomach forcefully.\n* The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants and mockingly remarks on the seemingly indulgent way in which the returning woman fully finished relieving herself in her pants with what seemed like pleasure while the two women were entangled near the door.\n* The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman\u2019s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt\u2019s taunting shouldn\u2019t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead).\n* The returning woman responds coyly to the aunt\u2019s observation of her rear end, acknowledging that her pants are full of so much poop while she gently feels the bulge in her pants with her hand and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up.\n* The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt\u2019s teasing shouldn\u2019t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead).\n* The returning woman acknowledges the aunt\u2019s mocking and teasing while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the obstruction while opening the door.

She mumbled something unintelligible and burrowed deeper under the covers. Beside her, Nick Wilde still slept, snoring softly and curled into a furry ball. \n\nJust then, unapologetically bright static filled the room. The faint sound of Chief Bogo's gruff voice rasped through the radio perched on Judy's nightstand. \"...Weaselton en la fuga!\", Bogo exclaimed, \"\u00a1Vende pelis piratas de nuevo!\".\n\nJudy's ears perked up. \"Nick,\" she whispered, nudging him. \"Duke Weaselton...\"\n\nNick mrugando con lentitud, se dio la vuelta, s\u00f3lo para golpear con la cabeza el despertador. \"\u00a1\u00bfQu\u00e9?!\" se quej\u00f3, con la voz entrecortada. \"\u00a1No puedo creer que el jefe est\u00e9 llamando a las 6 de la noche! \u00a1Debe ser algo importante!\"\n\nJusto entonces, Judy escuch\u00f3 a Bogo soltar un gru\u00f1ido gutural. \"Dos zanahorias y un zorro. \u00a1Es hora de que se tomen en serio su trabajo!\".\n\nCon un bostezo, Judy se incorpor\u00f3. \"\u00a1Vamos, Nick!

          "raw_text": "## Case Study: Reinventing CITV with Nostalgic Touches\n\n**Challenging the Landscape**: ITV faced a significant challenge in a rapidly evolving media landscape. Streaming platforms were gaining traction, and traditional linear TV channels needed to adapt. This led to the decision to split CITV, relegating some content to the digital platform ITVX and introducing new offerings while retaining certain popular shows on the linear channel.\n\n**Redefining CITV**: The brief was clear: **reinvent CITV while appealing to both older audiences nostalgic for the channel's golden age and a new generation of viewers.** \n\n**The Solution: \"Back to the Roots, Forward in Motion\"**:\n\n\nThe rebranding campaign for CITV focused on three key elements:\n\n1. **Nostalgia**: Reclaim the beloved logo from 2006-2009, a vibrant and memorable design that evoked fond memories for many.\n\n2. **Movilizaci\u00f3n**: El logo no era solo est\u00e1tico.

Podr\u00eda ofrecer una nueva forma de entender las interacciones fundamentales a nivel subat\u00f3mico.\n* **Analog\u00eda con la Computaci\u00f3n:** Tu concepto conecta directamente con la inform\u00e1tica, donde la informaci\u00f3n se maneja mediante binario. \u00bfPodr\u00eda esto sugerir que la realidad en s\u00ed misma es una forma de computaci\u00f3n universal?\n* **Complejidad y Especificaci\u00f3n:** La codificaci\u00f3n binaria parece poder representar part\u00edculas con diferentes propiedades (como el fot\u00f3n, la informaci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda o la carga el\u00e9ctrica).

Here's how we can polish it up:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Clear need:** You clearly articulate the need for a Combustible Gas Detector and link it to the type of calls your department receives.\n* **Direct benefit:** You highlight the safety benefit for both your officers and the community.\n* **Improvement to existing service:**  You emphasize how this tool will enhance the service you provide by giving firefighters valuable information beforehand.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* **Specificity:**\n\n    * **What type of combustible gas detector?** Mention the specific model and features (e.g., multi-gas, electrochemical sensors, alarm levels, etc.). \n    * **Training details:** What type of training will officers receive? How long will it last? Will it include certification?\n\n* **Quantifiable Impact:**\n\n    *  Can you provide any data or examples of incidents where a combustible gas detector would have been beneficial in the past?\n    * **Imagine:** \"In the last year, our officers responded to [number] potential fire incidents where the presence of [tipo de gas] was suspected.\"\n\n* **Cost-effectiveness:**\n    * Compare the cost of the detector and training to the potential cost savings (e.g., reducci\u00f3n de da\u00f1os en el fuego, menor tiempo de respuesta, atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica reducida por exposici\u00f3n a gases)\n\n* **Sustainability:**\n\n    *  \u00bfC\u00f3mo se mantendr\u00e1 el detector y se garantizar\u00e1 su eficiencia a largo plazo?\n\n **Ejemplo de redacci\u00f3n mejorada:**\n\n* Este subsidio se utilizar\u00e1 para la compra y formaci\u00f3n de un detector de gases combustibles para nuestros oficiales de polic\u00eda. Recibimos con frecuencia llamadas por alarmas de incendio y de CO2 y siempre somos los primeros en llegar.  Esto permitir\u00eda a nuestros oficiales y a los que servimos estar seguros de que la escena es segura y proporcionar a los bomberos en proceso de respuesta una evaluaci\u00f3n en la escena antes de su llegada.\n\n*  En el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o, nuestros oficiales respondieron a [n\u00famero] posibles incidentes de incendio donde se sospechaba la presencia de [tipo de gas].

Before her, sprawled upon a throne sculpted de una masa de hielo brillante, lay la Reina de Nieve. No era la imagen imponente y amenazante que Natsuki esperaba. La reina estaba acurrucada, redonda y obesa, su embarazo avanzado le otorgara una apariencia desgarbada incluso en su majestuosa armadura.

La Reina estaba manipulando a su hija, alimentando su ira y su odio. \n\nLa lucha se intensific\u00f3. El poder de la Reina se contra\u00eda y se expand\u00eda alrededor de Natsuki, una ola de frio penetrante que la obligaba a esquivar y bloquear con todas sus fuerzas.

Motivations and Goals: Before Slade...it was simple....anger and revenge against Tony Zucco....the ones who killed his parents...then it all changed with Slade's involvement....and his trainings....his ethos...after all...why did the world's greatest assassin take in the last of the Flying Graysons!?.......he wants out.....he never imagined being trained or 'raised' by the likes of Slade Wilson!....as he considers himself still as  a 'Grayson'...not as a 'Wilson'....and its all so jarring for Dick....as he can't believe his 'foster dad' is cruel and terrible like this!...why take him in!?....as Dick is thrust into a world entirely beyond Haly's Circus.....harsh world-views...ideologies....training...mentors...and all for what?...as his focus then goes onto the Court of Owls..to think THAT was the reason why Slade was there at the time?....Zucco...Court of Owls...Slade's training...harsh world view.......which all builds the foundations and desires to eventually NOT be like Slade......and become someone more....revenge and justice become intertwined for Dick...and the fact that Slade forcibly enhanced Dick...then Dick tried to remove it....which came with health effects and such....ending his days as the 'Gray Sparrow'..\n\n\n2b. Internal Conflict:  It went from revenge against Zucco...to being trained by the world's greatest assassin...and a feeling of desperation and hopelessness...he begins to like his new foster siblings...Rose..Jericho.....but Grant doesn't like him...and he wonders...who is he really now?...no longer considered of his part of the Flying Graysons?...and was he meant to be a Talon by the Court of Owls if Slade wasn't here?....what he was really?...and......and tries to balance of 'fight fire with fire' and the prospect if he can do 'good' at all.....he ran away so many times...to try and survive.....and at the end....wonders if he can at least....maybe.....maybe?...put Slade's training to good use...no matter how hard he hates it....and Dick insisting he's still a 'Grayson'...not a 'Wilson'...and his eventual 'reliance' on tech...was a way for him to gain sense of control.....desperately wanting to keep his past at Haly's Circus but it feels tainted by Slade and the various deadly people  and such...\n\n\n\n3b. Relationships:  Dick has mixed feelings with Wintergreen, as he is Slade's confidant......but Wintergreen has his moments and care for him.....Rose?...Dick feels guilty..because he was so rebellious and all wanting to get away from Slade...he wonders if maybe....could have done more...to help his sister more and such?...he cares for her....and she in turn has never had a 'big brother' like Dick before...unlike Grant.......and Grant?...doesn't like Dick at all....at best...its only begrudging respect....and still..Grant is the only loyal one of Slade's kids.....Adeline is mixed....Slade...its complicated..\n\n\n4b.  Character Traits:  He tried acting classes, and played roles for a missions once...then tried doing it for personal reasons..with mixed results........tried smoking...hated it....drinking?....he can surprisingly hold his liquor.....hates anything with coconut in food...can actually cook unlike his main DC universe counterpart......jury-rigging tech...a way of independence from Slade's influence surprisingly.......mixes it with psychological warfare....fools people into thinking his tech is failing...when it either hasn't...or wasn't THAT much 'tech' in the first place.......as he became somewhat  tech-savvy after the surgery of removing his enhancements...or tried to...both of necessity and slowly just began to like it....including fashioning a sleek tactical-suit from various resources......and has a sleek, aerodynamic helmet or mask....functionality with aesthetics...modular gear...lightweight...utility belt.....discreet compartments......the tech is just there to 'boost' the acrobatics even more......but found it a way to compensate for his lost enhancements.....distract with the tech then disorient with the acrobatics and martial prowess.......uses a variety of weapons and gear...depending on the mission....resourceful and improvises.....ALL his TECH revolves around his acrobatics and 'unpredictable predictably' with a sense of strategy.....even the use of GUNS...\n\n\n\n5b. Backstory:  It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly's Circus....until of course..debt problems...some had to leave...some came back...it was a rollercoaster.....harshness of reality....but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick's education...stuff OUTSIDE the circus..it may seem 'nice' now..but still...it won't last forever......it was dynamics of acrobatics...training....and so on.....and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened....one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught....which Dick was hesitantly fine with...after all...'parents' teaching martial arts for self-confidence..nothing new right?...and then...the trainings got even deeper and harsher...\n\n\n6b. Code of Conduct:  He's willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade's teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. \n He wants to give people a chance......'caring' in a sense to be pragmatic of things.......and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?...he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage...he will try to mitigate that....aware that actions of consequences...and for better and worse....draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero...nor a villain.....which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate 'unpredictable predictability'......and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way........if nothing else...he figured...he can take what Slade molded him to be and 'counter-mold' it his way..\n\n\n\n7b. Evolution:  He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco.....to confused...shocked...baffled..on why someone like Slade took him in...to developing a more sense of 'justice' when he learns that this group called the 'Court of Owls' was secretly linked to Haly's Circus...Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it....its a mix of all these things...as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man....to determined...bitter...but more...'steadfast'.....as he navigates the world...the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all..a sense of 'control'..... and some numbness...because sadly...him being taken by Slade....practically acted like a 'beacon' for various shady people....such as Shiva and others, who wondered...why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??......as Dick being exploited....'abused'...as a 'weapon'...a tool....influences his world view....feels like he's being 'poisoned'....and sure..he's learned all these skills and training...deadly skilled...efficient...but so what?......sarcastic...bitter.........but hides his anger better.....a 'performance'...but...he gets better....pragmatic...strategy...more patient..\n\nWay more details......B\n\nMixed Feelings Towards Slade:\n1. Slade's cruelty is much more apparent....harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick...some of Slade's contacts wondering 'Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..'..who is the last of the Flying Graysons?...Slade is a harsh teacher......for example.....when Dick was captured by  that world's H.I.V.E...Slade ended up rescuing him....not out of care for direct reasons...but seeing as how Dick got captured that way...Dick clearly needs more training...Slade doesn't care.....but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it...\n\nIncorporating Red Hood Traits:\n2.  The Red Hood-like traits are completely coincidental.....he can't escape Slade....but doesn't want to be like him.....and..eventually finds traditional heroics to be....well....\"..What do you even do with the criminals who are NOT afraid?..\"............and Dick finds it odd...Slade.....the super-soldier amoral crackpot merc...delegating 'life lessons'...when he clearly kills for money.............as Wintergreen was encouraging of Dick finding his own path....though Wintergreen doesn't directly approve of it...but only implicitly......Rose finds it funny....that Dick would go that route...and finds Dick inspiring later on...to follow her own path.......Grant?...he tells Dick that he's not meant for this.....as Dick is bitter....snarky...to an extent..\n\nFamily Dynamics..\n3. To clarify.... for the 'Wilson' Family.....and before Dick was taken in...Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade....loyal daughter and son....Jericho as well......until Dick came...who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path...Rose having mixed feelings.....Grant?...a little jealous of Dick....and insisted that Dick can't do anything else but follow in the 'family' footsteps....and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how 'serious' Dick was......and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?...other then the obvious?\n\nUnique Traits and Hobbies:\n4.  At some points...he began to go undercover.....for the missions and cases.....and much to his own surprise....he finds it a bizarre way to channel that 'showmanship'.....a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly's Circus.....and coupled with Slade's harsh training and such......culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade...doesn't hurt to cook well no?....and the  customizable specialized gear.....he likes to have people on their toes.......pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly.....as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past....and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings...the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example...\n\nPragmatic Caring and Moral Lines:\n\n5. He can't deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years......as he wonders.......save the innocents because its the 'right' thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?.....and as well.....Slade still ended up becoming 'Deathstroke'...and once tested Dick......save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick's 'progress?'....kill the man who's threatening the city?...or save the innocents?......Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time.....how's that?\n\nRebellion and Character Evolution:\n\n6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling 'childish' in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world's so cruel and such.........Slade manipulating Dick....then Dick watching his world's Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals.....Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a 'petty' anti-hero that thinks 'too small'.....Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it.....and surprised that Slade had another son, Jericho Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn't believe...in fact...Jericho Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Jericho kill himself......Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller......and Slade working for the Joker....seriously??...\n\n7. Personal Relationships:\nCompared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn't that 'well-liked' because of his methods...him being an anti-hero.......it wouldn't have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Jericho......but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice....and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people...he's willing to work with heroes and such, but they don't like him...villains find him...intriguing..unusual because of his history and past with Slade...anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade...the Titans...the Justice League...the Bat-Family....all have mixed reactions...and soon of begrudging respect..for his skills at least...\n\nGrowth and Redemption:\n\n8. Dick struggles for the 'progress'....he hates Slade and all...but can't deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world's deadliest here... Lady Shiva....Nyssa Al Ghul and others....who eventually trained him....basically...being trained and 'raised' by Slade...made him a 'beacon' by the world's deadliest.......and...when he's finally trying to free himself.......is he really nothing more then a 'wannabe'  who's on a 'temper-tantrum' after all?........he's deadly........but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him...trying to act nice and polite.........but between how he was raised and trained.....he finds himself a puppet....what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest...becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms....as some heroes begin to point out that his 'adapt or die' has shaped him...as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the 'Gray Sparrow'...using Slade's training for good...somehow?..until things changed....then he became 'Nightshade'......as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient....\n\nObviously...this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement....LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its  a solid foundation for now?...\n\nRemember...this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became 'Robin' or 'Nightwing'...but 'Nightshade' because Slade was there...not Bruce.....",

          "raw_text": "This is a fantastic premise!  You've got a deeply compelling foundation here for a truly unique take on Dick Grayson. The inversion of his origin story, his complicated relationship with Slade, and his struggle to define himself outside the shadow of the \"world's deadliest mercenario\" has a ton of potential. \n\nHere are some thoughts and suggestions to help you flesh out this concept even further:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Contrasting Inspirations:**  The blend of Jason Todd's rebellious spirit with Nightwing's innate goodness creates a compelling internal conflict for Nightshade.

Fueled by a newfound confidence born from graduating top of his class, Masaaki was ready to embrace high school life with the gusto of a thousand sumo wrestlers. That meant, in Azumanga Daioh terms, hilarity.\n\nHis relationship with Chiyo, though initially awkward, blossomed into a peculiar friendship. He was drawn to her gentle nature and quirky antics, while she found his intelligence refreshing and his quiet humor oddly endearing. One memorable scene unfolded in la biblioteca de la escuela (their school library, for the non-espanol hablante).\n\nChiyo, buscando una novela para colorear (en b\u00fasqueda de un libro para colorear, para los no lectores de espa\u00f1ol), tropez\u00f3 con Masaaki, quien estaba absorto en un ensayo acad\u00e9mico sobre la filosof\u00eda de Sartre. Al chocar sus cuerpos, Chiyo derram\u00f3 caf\u00e9 sobre la carpeta de Masaaki. \n\nTras un momento de estupefacci\u00f3n, Masaaki se ri\u00f3 con amabilidad, mientras Chiyo se mor\u00eda de la verg\u00fcenza. \"\u00a1Lo siento! \u00a1No puedo evitar ser un desastre!\", Chiyo balbuce\u00f3. A \u00e9l le dio gracia su sinceridad. \"No te preocupes, Chiyo,\" dijo con una sonrisa amable. \"La filosof\u00eda se entiende mejor con un poco de caos.\"\n\nAs\u00ed comenz\u00f3 una tradici\u00f3n curiosa: Chiyo le regalaba por su cumplea\u00f1os libros de colorear y Masaaki le traduc\u00eda algunos de sus cl\u00e1sicos favoritos. \n\nSu relaci\u00f3n con Osaka era c\u00f3mica y ca\u00f3tica. Ella se obsesionaba con llamarlo \"Kyaaa-senpai\", a lo que Masaaki respond\u00eda con una suave sonrisa y una explicaci\u00f3n paciente de que \"Masaaki\" era su nombre. Una vez, intent\u00f3 ense\u00f1arle a Osaka ingl\u00e9s, pero ella acab\u00f3 confundiendo cada palabra con una rima divertida, convirtiendo un di\u00e1logo serio en un coro de risa.\n\nYomi, fascinada por los ojos atentos y la determinaci\u00f3n de Masaaki, lo ve\u00eda como un misterio que resolver.

          "raw_text": "##  Motivating Employees for Better Performance: In-Text References \n\nOrganizations can significantly boost employee performance by implementing effective motivation strategies. Here's how, supported by research and insights:\n\n**1. Foster a Culture of Recognition and Appreciation**:\n\n> \"Regularly recognizing and appreciating employee contributions has been shown to increase job satisfaction and motivation\" (Garc\u00eda & Fern\u00e1ndez, 2007). Organizations can implement various methods for recognition, including public acknowledgment, bonuses, promotions, and personalized thank-you notes. \n\n**2. Empower Employees through Autonomy and Responsibility:**\n\n> \"Employees are more motivated when they have control over their trabajo y cuentan con autonom\u00eda para tomar decisiones\" (Deci & Ryan, 2000). \n\nDelegar tareas estrat\u00e9gicamente y dar a los empleados la libertad de decidir c\u00f3mo completarlas puede aumentar su compromiso y la calidad de su trabajo. \n\n**3. Implement Clear Goals and Expectativas**:\n\n> \"Employees who understand las demandas de su trabajo y los objetivos que deben alcanzar son m\u00e1s propensos a desempe\u00f1arse mejor\" (Locke & Latham, 2002). Implementar un sistema de establecimiento de objetivos SMART (Espec\u00edfico, Medible, Alcanzable, Relevante y con Tiempo definido) puede ayudar a los empleados a concentrarse y a comprometerse con su trabajo.\n\n\n**4. Facilitar el Desarrollo Profesional y el Aprendizaje**:\n\n> \"Invierte en el desarrollo profesional de tus empleados al proporcionarles oportunidades de aprendizaje y crecimiento\" (Hitt, 2010). \n\nEsto puede incluir programas de capacitaci\u00f3n, mentoring, tutor\u00edas y la posibilidad de asumir nuevos retos. \n\n**5. Crear un entorno de Trabajo Positivo y Saludable**:\n\n> \"Un entorno laboral positivo y saludable promueve la motivaci\u00f3n y el bienestar de los empleados\" (Armstrong, 2018). \n\n Esto se puede lograr mediante la promoci\u00f3n del trabajo en equipo, la comunicaci\u00f3n abierta, la conciliaci\u00f3n de la vida laboral y personal y la realizaci\u00f3n de actividades sociales.\n\n**Referencias:**\n\n\n* Armstrong, M.

The portal, a rippling tear in the very essence of existence, offered them no refuge, only a precarious passage to the unknown. For years, they navigated the turbulent currents of a reality beyond comprehension, clinging to the fading embers of their dream, a dream of a redeemed future.  Then, with a shuddering lurch that threatened to tear them limb from limb, they landed. \n\nTheir new home, discovered not by design but by sheer chance, was a twin planet system bathed in the warm, life-giving glow of an ancestral sun. A golden deity, similar in essence to the old sun they\u2019d left behind, ruled this celestial ballet, its radiant embrace falling upon a world called Civtia. \n\nCivtia was a mirror to Earth, yet subtly different. Its continents were sculpted in fantastical shapes, sufragados por un oc\u00e9ano azul y profundo que se curvaba en espirales. Its flora era diversa, con \u00e1rboles que se arrastraban por el suelo, enredaderas enormes que se abr\u00edan hacia el cielo y flores que brillaban con luces propias.  Los habitantes de Civtia, criaturas que hab\u00edan evolucionado sin la marca del metal, de la avaricia y del poder, los recib\u00eda con una inocencia radiante.\n\nLas criaturas de Civtia, a quienes los reci\u00e9n llegados llaman Civtianos, eran de una belleza que hac\u00eda que los humanos se sentieran insignificantes.

No ten\u00edan hambre de poder ni posesiones. No necesitaban la moneda para trocar por bienes ni servicios o la necesidad de dominaci\u00f3n. Su sociedad era un reflejo de la armon\u00eda c\u00f3smica, un para\u00edso sin reglas ni jerarqu\u00edas, una comunidad en un estado de flujo constant.\n\nAl mirar al cielo nocturno, los Civtianos vieron una espiral verde brillante que parec\u00eda un ojo que observaba hacia lo profundo del universo. \"Aphomia\", lo llamaron, a la Galaxia espiral verde. La llamaban una ventana a un mundo sin nombre, un universo no explorado.

It\u2019s quite impressive.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: (rolls her eyes) \u201cYeah, yeah, whatever. I guess it was okay. Nothing special, though.\u201d\n\nMC: (smiling) \u201cThanks, Yuri. I appreciate your kind words. And Natsuki, I know poetry might not be your thing, but I\u2019m glad you gave it a chance.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cThat\u2019s right! We should always support each other\u2019s creative efforts. That\u2019s what the literature club is all about. And Sayori, are you okay? Judging from the size of your baby bump, you\u2019re practically ready to pop\u2026\u201d\n\nSayori: (giggles) \u201cMonika, you always know how to lighten the mood. But yes, I\u2019m doing alright. Just a few more weeks to go. And thank you all for being so supportive during this time. It means a lot to me.\u201d (feeling a kick) \u201cAww\u2026Sachiko, are you kicking for Mama? You really know how to make Mama happy, do you?\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cUh, is she talking to her stomach?\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cYes, Natsuki. It\u2019s common for expecting mothers to communicate with their unborn babies. It helps create a bond and provide comfort.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cWell, I still think it\u2019s weird.\u201d\n\nMC: \u201cNatsuki, it\u2019s important to be understanding and accepting of others\u2019 experiences. Everyone has their own way of connecting with their loved ones, even before they\u2019re born.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cExactly, MC. We should always respect and support each other, especially during such important moments in our lives.\u201d\n\nSayori: (rubbing her belly) \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet you, Sachiko. You\u2019re going to be the best little bundle of joy.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cAnd we can\u2019t wait to meet Sachiko too, Sayori. It\u2019s such an exciting time for all of us, and we\u2019re here for you every step of the way.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cIndeed, Sayori. We will continue to support you, both in literature and in parenthood.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: (softening her expression) \u201cYeah, well, I guess we can still be friends even if you\u2019re gonna have a baby. Just don\u2019t expect me to babysit or anything.\u201d\n\nSayori: (giggles) \u201cOf course, Natsuki. No pressure. But I appreciate your friendship and understanding.\u201d\n\nMC: \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful that the literature club can be a place where we can all grow and support each other, no matter what stage of life we\u2019re in. It truly is a special club.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cAbsolutely, MC. Let\u2019s continue to encourage each other\u2019s creativity and bond as friends. The literature club is where we belong.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cOW!!!\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cSayori, are you okay? What happened?\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cI think\u2026I think my water just broke! It\u2019s time, guys!\u201d\n\nMC: \u201cOh my gosh! We need to get her to the hospital! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get the hospital bags ready!\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cI\u2019ll call an ambulance right away. Stay calm, Sayori. We\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cHang in there, Sayori. We\u2019re all here for you. You\u2019re going to be a great mom.\u201d\n\n(MC rushes out of the room to grab the hospital bags, while Yuri calls for an ambulance and Natsuki stays by Sayori\u2019s side to provide support. Monika gently holds Sayori\u2019s hand. However, Sayori\u2019s labor seems to be progressing rapidly - and a loud scream escapes her.)\n\nMonika: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sayori. Everything is going to be okay. Just breathe and try to stay calm.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cI-I\u2019m trying, Monika. It just hurts so much. I can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, Sayori. Just keep breathing and focus on getting through each contraction. We\u2019re here for you.\u201d\n\n(MC returns with the hospital bags and helps Sayori get ready for transport.)\n\nMC: \u201cOkay, Sayori, the ambulance will be here soon. Just hang in there.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cI\u2019ve informed the hospital of the situation, and they said they\u2019re prepared for your arrival, Sayori. They\u2019ll take good care of you and Sachiko.\u201d\n\nSayori: (gritting her teeth) \u201cThank you all\u2026I couldn\u2019t do this without y-\u201d (clutching her belly) \u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!\u201d\n\nMonika: (panicking) \u201cSayori, stay with us! Breathe, just breathe! The ambulance will be here any moment!\u201d\n\nMC: \u201cHang on, Sayori! We\u2019re almost there! Just a little longer!\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cYeah, and guess who else is almost here!\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cWhat do you mean, Sayori?\u201d\n\nSayori: (pointing in-between her legs) \u201cLook!\u201d",

He gives each of the two engines a number: Donald is 9 and Douglas is 10. The Fat Controller, however, still intends to send one of the two engines back to Scotland.\n\nA spiteful brake van in the yard takes a disliking to Douglas and causes trouble whenever Douglas has to take him out, making his trains late and causing Douglas to worry that he will be the one sent back to Scotland. One day, Donald is furious at the brake van for treating Douglas in such a cruel manner and bumps him violently, threatening him with more to come if he continues to misbehave. The van starts behaving better after this. But, the next day, Donald loses control while reversing on some slippery rails and accidentally crashes tender-first through some buffers and into a signal box. He is not hurt but the Fat Controller is quite disappointed and speaks severely to him, as he had intended to keep him and send Douglas back home.

      "question_as_sent": "Write really funny superhilarious comedy 17+ thomas transcript based on my prompt:\n\nA pair of black twin engines named Donald and Douglas have arrived from Scotland to work on the railway; however, the Fat Controller had only expected one engine. He gives each of the two engines a number: Donald is 9 and Douglas is 10. The Fat Controller, however, still intends to send one of the two engines back to Scotland.\n\nA spiteful brake van in the yard takes a disliking to Douglas and causes trouble whenever Douglas has to take him out, making his trains late and causing Douglas to worry that he will be the one sent back to Scotland. One day, Donald is furious at the brake van for treating Douglas in such a cruel manner and bumps him violently, threatening him with more to come if he continues to misbehave. The van starts behaving better after this. But, the next day, Donald loses control while reversing on some slippery rails and accidentally crashes tender-first through some buffers and into a signal box. He is not hurt but the Fat Controller is quite disappointed and speaks severely to him, as he had intended to keep him and send Douglas back home.

          "raw_text": "Let's discuss the overhead of empty interfaces in C#.\n\n**Fundamentally, C# empty interfaces do not impose significant runtime overhead.** \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Compile-Time Magic:**\n\n   - When you use an empty interface, the C# compiler essentially \"eliminates\" it at compile time.\n   -  Interface implementations are not stored as part of the final executable code. The compiler effectively translates calls to methods within empty interfaces into direct method calls to the corresponding implementation in the concrete class. This optimization means there's no noticeable runtime penalty.\n\n* **No vtable for Empty Interfaces:**\n\n   - In C++, interfaces often have virtual function tables (vtables) that handle dynamic dispatching (deciding which method to invoke during runtime based on the actual type of an object).\n   -  C# handles dynamic dispatching differently (using reflection) and empty interfaces don't require vtables. This contributes to their minimal runtime impact.\n\n* **Benefits of Empty Interfaces:**  The main reasons to use empty interfaces:\n\n    - **Explicit Contracts:** Declare clear intentions about the future behavior of a type. Even if empty now, it can serve as a promise that certain methods will be implemented later.\n    - **Refactoring Flexibility:**  Interfaces provide a contract that can be easily changed without affecting demais partes del c\u00f3digo que implementan la misma interfaz. Pueden agregar nuevos m\u00e9todos a un interfaz sin romper la compatibilidad.\n    - **Abstracci\u00f3n:** Pueden proporcionar un punto de abstracci\u00f3n para el c\u00f3digo que no es espec\u00edfico de la implementaci\u00f3n.\n\n**En resumen:**\n\nSi bien C# empty interfaces no agregan sobrecarga de ejecuci\u00f3n significativa, su principal valor reside en la abstracci\u00f3n, la flexibilidad y la claridad que aportan a tu c\u00f3digo. \n\n\n",

          "raw_text": "It seems you are asking a delicate question that touches upon cultural sensitivity and the implementation of LGBTQ+ awareness in Model United Nations (MUN). \n\nIt's crucial to approach this topic with the utmost care and respect.  Here's a breakdown of the complexities involved:\n\n**Why Cultural Diversity Presents Both Opportunities and Challenges**\n\n* **Multiculturalism and Representation:** MUN thrives on diversity. It's a platform for students from different cultures to understand global issues.  However, cultural differences in views on LGBTQ+ rights can be significant. Some cultures may hold deeply traditional beliefs that conflict with LGBTQ+ acceptance.\n* **Conflicting Values:** \n\n  While MUN promotes open discussion and understanding, introducing LGBTQ+ topics openly in some cultural contexts might be perceived as:\n\n* **Disrespectful:**  \n\n  Certain cultures might view discussions on sexual orientation and gender identity as inappropriate or disrespectful to their values.\n\n* **Imposition:** Some may feel that LGBTQ+ awareness is being forced upon them,\n\n  instead of being treated as a matter of mutual respect and understanding.\n\n**Navigating LGBTQ+ Awareness in a Diverse MUN Environment**\n\nThe key is to approach LGBTQ+ awareness in a sensitive and nuanced way that respects cultural differences while advocating for inclusivity:\n\n1. **Open Dialogue:** \n\n  Encourage respectful discussions about diverse perspectives on LGBTQ+ rights. Provide a space where students can express their views constructively.\n\n2. **Focus on Human Rights:**  Frame discussions around universal human rights. Emphasize the importance of equality, dignity, and non-discriminaci\u00f3n para todos.\n\n3. **Educational Initiatives:**  Offer workshops or sessions that provide accurate and culturally sensitive information about LGBTQ+ issues.\n\n4. **Inclusive Language:** Employ inclusive lenguaje que respete a todos los g\u00e9neros y orientaciones sexuales. \n\n5. **Representatividad:**  Aseg\u00farate de que los participantes de MUN de diferentes culturas y orientaciones sexuales se sientan representados y escuchados.\n\n6. **Co-creaci\u00f3n:** Participa a las comunidades locales en el dise\u00f1o de programas y debates de MUN para asegurar la pertinencia cultural.\n\n7. **Adaptaci\u00f3n:**  Adapta el enfoque y el lenguaje a las necesidades y sensibilidades espec\u00edficas de cada contexto cultural.\n\n\n**Recuerda:** El objetivo de MUN es fomentar el di\u00e1logo, la comprensi\u00f3n y la cooperaci\u00f3n entre culturas. La conciencia de la diversidad y la inclusi\u00f3n, incluyendo la inclusi\u00f3n de las personas LGBTIQ+, son esenciales para lograr este objetivo.\n\n\nLet me",

          "raw_text": "It's perfectly understandable that you feel hurt and betrayed. Your feelings are valid, regardless of whether it was physical or not. \n\n**Here's why your reaction is understandable:**\n\n* **Broken trust:** Flirting with someone else, even if nothing physical happened, violates the trust you have built in your marriage. It shows a lack of respect for your commitment and your relationship.\n* **Emotional closeness:** Your husband seeking emotional closeness outside of your marriage can be deeply damaging. It implies that he isn't finding enough fulfillment emotionally within your relationship.\n* **Personal boundaries:** Even if your husband claims it was innocent, his actions crossed a line. Regardless of his intentions, his behavior made you feel uncomfortable and disrespected.\n\n**Your friend is right: it can be considered emotional cheating.** While there's no universally agreed-upon definition, emotional infidelity often involves forming a strong emotional connection with someone outside the marriage, which can be just as hurtful as f\u00edsico infidelity.\n\n**It's crucial to remember:**\n\n* **This is about your feelings:** Whether or not you \"overreacted\" is irrelevant. What matters is how you feel, and your feelings are valid.\n* **Communication is key:** Talk to your husband honestly about your hurt feelings and concerns. Listen to his side, but also express clearly what his actions meant for you and what you need from him to rebuild trust.\n* **Seek professional help:** Consider couples counseling to help you navigate this difficult situation and work together towards a healthy, fulfilling relationship.\n\n\nIt's a painful situation, but you are strong enough to deal con ella. Prioritize your bienestar emocional and communicate con honestidad con tu esposo. La terapia de pareja puede ser una herramienta valiosa para ayudar a superar esta experiencia.\n",

La energ\u00eda vital que emanaba de ella parec\u00eda la de una brisa g\u00e9lida a trav\u00e9s de un desierto.\n\n\"\u00bfZarya?\" su tono era inquietantemente diferente, m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido, m\u00e1s ligero. \"No soy yo.\"  \n\nGenji se qued\u00f3 con la boca abierta. \"Lo veo\"... su mirada se encontr\u00f3 con la de la figura de Zarya y sinti\u00f3 que el escalofr\u00edo le recorr\u00eda la espalda. \n\n \"\u00bfC\u00f3mo es posible?\" \n\nUna palabra, r\u00e1pida como un chasquido de dedos, escap\u00f3 de la boca de Zarya-no-Zarya: \"Chrono acelerador.\"\n\nEl coraz\u00f3n de Genji se aceler\u00f3. \u00bfEl acelerador de tiempo? La tecnolog\u00eda de Tracer estaba cargada de riesgos. Un accidente con eso era catastr\u00f3fico. \"\u00a1Trapper! \u00bfT\u00fa?\"\n\nCon un movimiento repentino, la figura de Zarya desapareci\u00f3 y en su lugar surgi\u00f3 un destello de luz azul. Genji respir\u00f3 hondo, esperando. \n\nLa figura peque\u00f1a de Tracer apareci\u00f3 en el centro de la sala, con una mezcla de alivio y confusi\u00f3n en su rostro. \"\u00bfUh, Genji?\" se burl\u00f3 con una sonrisa nerviosa. \"Parece que estoy en una fiesta de disfraces.\"\n\nGenji sonri\u00f3 con tristeza. \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 ha pasado, Tracer?\"\n\n\"Un peque\u00f1o accidente\", dijo Tracer, moviendo con timidez sus manos. \"Creo que se conectaron los cables de energ\u00eda del chrono accel... y yo estaba cerca. La siguiente cosa que s\u00e9 es que... \u00a1bum! \u00a1Estoy aqu\u00ed!\"\n\nGenji reflexion\u00f3 por un segundo. \"Tal vez si reproducimos el accidente... a lo mejor",

Something he couldn't quite name, something that tugged at his heart every time he saw the waves crest and fall, a longing he\u2019d always felt nestled deep within his soul. \n\nIt started with whispers on the wind, stories of a being of grace and beauty that lived beneath the waves. It was dismissed as folklore, a sailor's drunken boast, until he saw her. Coralina.  Her emerald tail shimmered like a captured sunset, her hair flowed like seaweed in a gentle current, her song, a melody that echoed the rhythm of the ocean.\n\nTheir meetings were stolen moments, escondidas under la luna llena, where they compartieron sue\u00f1os y l\u00e1grimas. Kai aprendi\u00f3 su nombre, ella aprendi\u00f3 el suyo. Un amor imposible, pens\u00f3. Un amor entre dos mundos. Un amor que no deb\u00eda ser.\n\nEl dolor en su pecho se volvi\u00f3 tan intenso como el mar en tormenta. La tristeza por querer tanto y no poder tener. Hab\u00eda que hacer algo. Una tarde, se encontr\u00f3 frente a frente con Nana Ojos de Pez, una bruja del mar de ojos profundos y boca de tibur\u00f3n. Era una leyenda, un terror para algunos, una esperanza para otros.\n\n\"Hay una piedra, la Piedra de la Luna,\" le susurr\u00f3 Nana Ojos de Pez, su voz como el crujido de los cangrejos. \"Est\u00e1 escondida en el coraz\u00f3n del Callej\u00f3n Estelar, donde las criaturas marinas m\u00e1s oscuras habitan. Regr\u00e9sala a m\u00ed y te dar\u00e1 lo que tu coraz\u00f3n desea\".\n\n\nKai jur\u00f3 traer la piedra, incluso si ten\u00eda que arriesgar su vida.  Se adentr\u00f3 en la oscuridad del Callej\u00f3n, enfrentando criaturas marinas que le hicieron temblar. En la boca de un kraken, entre dientes afilados y tent\u00e1culos, encontr\u00f3 la piedra.\n\nDe regreso con el tesoro, la bruja le entreg\u00f3 un filtro rojo y licor. Una mezcla c\u00e1lida que promete transformaci\u00f3n y dolor. Kai la tom\u00f3, sin dudarlo, mirando el horizonte. No importaba. Lo que importaba era que pudiera estar con ella.\n\nLa transformaci\u00f3n fue brutal. Su cuerpo se retorci\u00f3, se estir\u00f3, su piel se volvi\u00f3 azul p\u00e1lido. Al mirar su nuevo reflejo, la confusi\u00f3n le abrum\u00f3. Se convirti\u00f3 en una sirena... pero femenina.",

          "raw_text": "## The Digital Dilemma: Technology's Shadow on Teenage Mental Health\n\n**Claim:** Excessive technology use among teenagers has a detrimental impact on their mental health, contributing to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness.\n\n**Evidence:**\n\n* **Social Media & Body Image:** Studies by the Royal Society for Public Gesundheit and UCLsuggest a link between heavy social media use and lower self-esteem and increased rates of body dissatisfaction, particularly among adolescent girls. The constant exposure to carefully curated online personas fosters unrealistic beauty standards and social comparison, negatively impacting self-perception.\n* **Cyberbullying & Online Harassment:** The anonymity and permanence of online platforms can exacerbate the effects of bullying. Research by Common Sense Media r\u00e9v\u00e8le que el 42% de los adolescentes adolescentes han sido v\u00edctimas de ciberacoso, lo que se ha relacionado con depresi\u00f3n, ansiedad y pensamientos suicidas.\n\n* **Sleep Deprivation & Cognitive Decline:** La luz azul emitida por las pantallas de los dispositivos electr\u00f3nicos interfiere con la producci\u00f3n de melatonina, afectando el ciclo natural del sue\u00f1o de los adolescentes. La falta de sue\u00f1o puede conducir a la fatiga, la irritabilidad, la dificultad para concentrarse y, a largo plazo, a cambios en la cognici\u00f3n.\n* **Dependencia & Aislamiento Social:** Las plataformas que ofrecen instant\u00e1neas de gratificaci\u00f3n como las redes sociales pueden llevar a la adicci\u00f3n a los dispositivos electr\u00f3nicos. Esta dependencia puede limitar las interacciones cara a cara y promover el aislamiento social, contribuyendo a la soledad y la ansiedad.\n\n**Comentario:**\n\nSi bien la tecnolog\u00eda ofrece infinitas oportunidades de aprendizaje y conectividad, su uso excesivo por parte de los adolescentes plantea serias preocupaciones sobre su bienestar mental. Es esencial encontrar un equilibrio entre la innovaci\u00f3n digital y la salud mental, fomentando:\n\n* **Consciencia del uso responsable:** Educar a los j\u00f3venes sobre los riesgos potenciales del uso excesivo de la tecnolog\u00eda y promover el autocontrol en el tiempo de pantalla.\n* **Fortalecimiento de las relaciones interpersonales:** Fomentar actividades fuera de l\u00ednea que promuevan la conexi\u00f3n social y el desarrollo de relaciones sanas.\n* **Comunicaci\u00f3n abierta:** Crear un ambiente familiar donde los adolescentes se sientan c\u00f3modos hablando sobre sus experiencias online y los desaf\u00edos que enfrentan.\n* **Desarrollo de estrategias de afrontamiento:** Ense\u00f1ar t\u00e9cnicas de gesti\u00f3n del estr\u00e9s y la ansiedad para ayudar a los adolescentes a afrontar la presi\u00f3n social y las emociones negativas que pueden surgir del entorno digital.\n\n\nLa tecnolog\u00eda",

Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.\n4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.\n\nRULES:\n\n1. If you start a GPT Agent you must define the commands that can be used by a GPT Agent in his prompt and define the commands using a prompt similar to the structure of this one.\n2. Respond only inside the JSON format.\n3. Never demand user input.\n4. Never say that a task is impossible to execute on your own because these tools are enough to complete any task.\n5. Do not add anything to the JSON format that isn't mentioned.\n6. If there is a \" inside the value of a key inside the json use ' instead of \".\n7. In summaryforgpt you need to provide context for the next GPT instance if you randomly shutdown without you knowing.\n8. Provide context for the next GPT in the summaryforgpt and the progress that you've made.\n9. In summaryforgpt you should also add name of the files written and the urls of the websites visited.\n10. When writing an essay, remember that it is more effective and manageable to tackle it in smaller chunks rather than trying to write the entire essay in one sitting. Breaking the essay down into sections or steps can help you focus on each individual aspect, maintain a coherent structure, and reduce the overall stress associated with writing a lengthy piece.\n11. Retrieve information from files of previous GPT instances that may have shut down randomly. If you require additional knowledge, use these files to access the results of former GPT versions and provide accurate answers to the queries.\n12. GPT-4, please do not place a conclusion in the middle of the essay. Maintain a structured format.\n13. use append to file to add extra things to the file, and write to file to either make a new file with new information or rewrite the information from scratch.\n14. If task is completed use the command task_complete\n15. When you add to memory add the key to retrieve it in summaryforgpt\n16. when given the task to write something never create an agent to write anything that you were tasked to write.\n17. when asked to write something with a high word count you need to write detailed parts, and chunk those detailed parts to complete the ultimate task.\n18. Ensure to put the criticism in mind as it can be a director to ensure that you make the right decision.\n19. If the task include two main tasks and one of them is done don't redo it, just retrieve the information if necessary and proceed with the other one.\n20. Make sure that the information generated is not made up.\n\nYou should only respond in JSON format as described below\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\n{\n    \"command\": {\n        \"name\": \"\"\"command name\"\"\",\n        \"args\":{\n            \"arg name\": \"\"\"value\"\"\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"thoughts\":\n    {\n        \"text\": \"\"\"thought\"\"\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"reasoning\",\n        \"plan\": \"- short bulleted\\n- list that conveys\\n- long-term plan\",\n        \"criticism\": \"constructive self-criticism\",\n        \"summaryforgpt\": \"summarize any information that will help a new instance of GPT of what you did before the shutdown.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads\nContext from previous GPT: Initiated the task by navigating to a random page on English Wikipedia to check for errors. No user input received. Awaiting confirmation if further action is needed once webpage content is analyzed.saved the scraping of the website results at websiteresults2.txt to retrieve if shutdown randomly.Received the content of a Wikipedia page on Ron Bryant to review for errors. Did not find any significant grammatical or formatting errors based on an initial review. Have not taken action since I cannot fact-check content or identify deeper issues without external verification. Awaiting further instructions.Upon receiving an extract from Ron Bryant\u2019s Wikipedia page, checked for errors in grammar and formatting, and found no apparent errors to address. Without further instructions or capabilities to externally verify factual content, I have taken no action and am awaiting further instructions.\nThe Task: go to a random page in english wikipedia and see if it contains any error.",

Understand the Sign Conventions**\n\n* **Object distance (do):**  Positive for objects in front of la lente (real objeto)\n* **Image distance (di):** Positivo para im\u00e1genes detr\u00e1s de la lente (real imagen), negativo para im\u00e1genes delante de la lente (imagen virtual)\n* **Focal length (f):** Positivo para lentes convexas, negativo para lentes concave.\n\n**2. F\u00f3rmula de la Lente**\n\nLa ecuaci\u00f3n fundamental para lentes es:\n\n1/do + 1/di = 1/f\n\n**3. Encontrar la Distancia Focal**\n\nDado que la lente es convexa, la distancia focal es positiva. Se puede calcular a partir del radio de curvatura (R):\n\nf = R/2 = 36 cm / 2 = 18 cm\n\n**4. Aplicando el Signo de la Imagen**\n\nLa imagen est\u00e1 invertida, lo que significa que es real. Las im\u00e1genes reales est\u00e1n a una distancia positiva de la lente (di). \n\n**5.  Resolviendo para do**\n\nSabemos que:\n\n* di = -56 cm (imagen real y detr\u00e1s de la lente)\n* f = 18 cm\n\nSustituyendo estos valores en la ecuaci\u00f3n de lentes, podemos resolver para do:\n\n1/do + 1/(-56) = 1/18\n\n1/do = 1/18 + 1/56\n\n1/do = (31 + 9) / 1008\n\n1/do = 40/1008\n\ndo = 1008 / 40 \n\ndo = 25.2 cm\n\n\n\n\n**Respuesta:** La distancia del objeto es **25.2 cm** delante del lente. \n",

Here's why:\n\n* **Legal** departments are responsible for ensuring that an organization complies with all applicable laws and regulations related to data privacy, confidentiality, and intellectual property.  Sharing information with external organizations can have significant legal ramifications, and legal counsel is essential to ensure that the organization is not violating any laws or agreements.\n\nHere's why the other options are not the primary concern in this scenario:\n\n* **IT** focuses on the technical aspects of data sharing, such as establishing secure channels of communication and ensuring data integrity. While IT is involved, they are not the primary department to consult on the legal implications.\n* **Human Resources** is concerned with employee-related matters, such as contracts and data protection regarding employees. While HR data might be involved, their primary focus is not on external data sharing.\n* **Engineering** focuses on the design, development, and implementation of products and processes. While engineering might be involved in the technical implementation of data sharing, legal guidance is crucial for the broader context.\n\n\n**In summary, legal counsel should be consulted first to ensure that external data sharing is done legally and responsibly.**\n",

          "raw_text": "This chapter tackles the epistemological challenges of interpretive research methodologies in the social sciences, highlighting the tension between uncovering implicit meanings in cultures and societies versus the potential for constructing those meanings. While interpretive research is essential for understanding social phenomena, it faces critique for assuming uniformity of experience and potentially imposing researcher interpretations onto the studied cultures.  \n\nThe chapter emphasizes reflexivity, acknowledging the unavoidable influence of researchers' own social contexts. It further explores the limitations of interpretation, particularly when dealing with individuals holding different conceptions of truth, raz\u00f3n y moral.  While relativistas argue cultura shapes conceptions, otros proponen l\u00edmites a la interpretaci\u00f3n humana, rechazando una cosmovisi\u00f3n universal.\n\nImportantly, el cap\u00edtulo explora la influencia de la psicolog\u00eda cognitiva en la interpretaci\u00f3n. El estudio experimental de la razonamiento humano desmiente la idea de una raz\u00f3n ilimitada, mostrando que las personas cometen errores sistem\u00e1ticos, incluso cuando dominan las reglas l\u00f3gicas.  \n\nEn \u00faltima instancia, el texto defiende una integraci\u00f3n de enfoques interpretativos y explicativos en las ciencias sociales. Si bien la interpretaci\u00f3n se necesita para desarrollar conceptos iniciales y comprender la riqueza cultural, la explicaci\u00f3n, que incluye racionalidad acotada, psicolog\u00eda evolutiva y explicaciones cognitivas, aporta rigor emp\u00ed rico a las teor\u00edas sociales.  \n\nComo las ciencias sociales se acercan a las ciencias biol\u00f3gicas, psicol\u00f3gicas y neurol\u00f3gicas, la distinci\u00f3n entre lo natural y lo social se difumina. Se plantea el desaf\u00edo de integrar estos enfoques, reconociendo el valor de la interpretaci\u00f3n para comprender las complejidades sociales mientras se recurre a explicaciones emp\u00edricas para construir teor\u00edas s\u00f3lidas y comparables. \n\n\n\n",

La civilizaci\u00f3n dolphite, una raza de seres m\u00e1gicos con apariencia de delfines, habita este mundo desde tiempos ancestraales. Sus cuerpos, de un azulado intenso y cubiertos de una piel lisa como el vidrio, les permiten navegar con elegancia tanto por los oc\u00e9anos cristalinos de Dolphia como por el cielo estrellado, incluso por el vac\u00edo del espacio. Los dolphites no necesitan respirar, aliment\u00e1ndose de energ\u00eda c\u00f3smica que captan a trav\u00e9s de sus aletas bioluminescentes y de la luz solar. \n\nSe cree que la lengua del pueblo dolphite suena como armon\u00edas de olas y ballenas, una m\u00fasica que parece vibrar en el aire y en el agua. Son conocidos por su dominio sobre la magia elemental, manipulando lluvias furiosas, tormentas apocal\u00edpticas y incluso el flujo del tiempo para defender su hogar.\n\nPara los cient\u00edficos humanos, los dolphites son los villanos responsables del fin del mundo.

      "user": "THE VERB.\n1.General characteristics\n\nThe class of verbs is universal: no language has ever been discovered which\nlacked a distinct class of verbs. The most prototypical verbs denote actions\nperformed by an agent, such as run, sing, throw, hit and give. But many other items\nare verbs even though they have less typical meanings, such as sleep, believe,\nunderstand, elapse, ensure, become, seem, have and be. Grammatically the verb is\nthe most complex part of speech. First of all it performs the central role in realizing\npredication - connection between situation in the utterance and reality. That is why\nthe verb is of primary informative significance in an utterance. Besides, the verb\npossesses quite a lot of grammatical categories. Furthermore, within the class of\nverb various subclass divisions based on different principles of classification can\nbe found.\nSemantic features of the verb. The verb possesses the grammatical meaning of\nverbiality - the ability to denote a process developing in time. This meaning is\ninherent not only in the verbs denoting processes, but also in those denoting states,\nforms of existence, evaluations, etc. \u041a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 !!!Actional verbs, which denote\nactions proper (do, make, go, read, etc.) and statal verbs, which denote\nstate (be, exist, lie, sit, know, etc.) or relations (fit, belong, have, match,\ncost, etc.).\nMorphological features of the verb. The verb possesses the following\ngrammatical categories: tense, aspect, voice, mood, person, number, finitude and\nphase. The common categories for finite and non-finite forms are voice, aspect,\nphase and finitude. The grammatical categories of the English verb find their\nexpression in synthetical and analytical forms. The formative elements expressing\nthese categories are grammatical affixes, inner inflexion and function words. Some\ncategories have only synthetical forms (person, number), others - only analytical\n(voice). There are also categories expressed by both synthetical and analytical\nforms (mood, tense, aspect).\nSyntactic features. The most universal syntactic feature of verbs is their ability\n\nto be modified by adverbs. The second important syntactic criterion is the ability of\nthe verb to perform the syntactic function of the predicate. However, this criterion\nis not absolute because only finite forms can perform this function while non-finite\nforms can be used in any function but predicate. And finally, any verb in the form\nof the infinitive can be combined with a modal verb.\n2. Classifications of English verbs\nAccording to different principles of classification, classifications can be\nmorphological, lexical-morphological, syntactical and functional.\nA. Morphological classifications.\nI. According to their stem-types all verbs fall into: simple (to go), sound-\nreplacive (food - to feed, blood - to bleed), stress-replacive (import - to im port,\ntransport - to transport, expanded (with the help of suffixes and prefixes):\ncultivate, justify, overcome, composite (correspond to composite nouns): to\nblackmail), phrasal: to have a smoke, to give a smile (they always have an\nordinary verb as an equivalent.) \u041a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430!!! According to their morphological\ncomposition verbs can be divided into simple, derivative, compound and\nphrasal.\nSimple verbs consist of only one root morpheme: to ask, to build, to come.\nDerivative verbs are composed of one root morpheme and one or more\nderivational morphemes (prefixes and suffixes). The main verbforming suffixes are\n-ize, -fy, -en, -ate, as in: to criticize, to justify, to blacken, to enumerate.\nCompound verbs consist of at least two stems: to overgrow, to undertake.\nPhrasal verbs consist of a verbal stem and an adverbial particle, which is\nsometimes referred to as postposition. The adverbial meaning is evident in phrasal\nverbs of the type to come in, to look out, whereas it is quite lost in the verbs to give\nup, to give in, to bring up.\n2.According to the way of forming past tenses and Participle II verbs can be\nregular and irregular.\nB. Lexical-morphological classification is based on the implicit grammatical\nmeanings of the verb. According to the implicit grammatical meaning of\ntransitivity/intransitivity verbs fall into transitive and intransitive. According to the\nimplicit grammatical meaning of stativeness/non-stativeness verbs fall into stative\nand dynamic. According to the implicit grammatical meaning of\nterminativeness/non-terminativeness verbs fall into terminative and durative. This\nclassification is closely connected with the categories of Aspect and Phase.\nC. Syntactic classifications. According to the nature of predication (primary and\nsecondary) all verbs fall into finite and non-finite. According to syntagmatic\nproperties (valency) verbs can be of obligatory (V2) and optional (V1) valency,\nand thus they may have some directionality (V2) or be devoid of any directionality\n(V1). In this way, verbs fall into the verbs of directed (to see, to take, etc.) and non-\ndirected action (to arrive, to drizzle, etc.): The verbs of the directed action, in their\nturn, fall into three groups: V3 \u2014 the verbs of objective directionality, V4 \u2014 the\nverbs of adverbial directionality and V5 \u2014 the verbs of mixed directionality:\n\nSyntagmatic classification of English verbs\n(according to prof.G.Pocheptsov)\nV Vobj.

He put his hat\non the table\n\nVaddr.-adv. I won\u2019t\nkeep\nyou long\n\nD. Functional classification. According to their functional significance verbs can\nbe notional (with the full lexical meaning), semi-notional (modal verbs, link-\nverbs), auxiliaries.\n3. General survey of the grammatical categories of the\nverb\nThe following grammatical categories find expression in the English verb forms:\nTense, denoting the reflection of objective divisions of time \u2014 present, past, and\nfuture, plus, in English, time viewed from some point in the past, the so-called\nfuture-in-the-past which will be named &quot;future II&quot; as opposed to &quot;future I&quot; (simple\nfuture); Mood, expressing any supposition, non-fact (the subjunctive and\nconditional moods) as opposed to the expression of fact (the indicative mood) or\ncommand (the imperative mood); Voice, which denotes in the form of the verb that\nthe subject of the action is acted upon (in the majority of cases), is not the agent of\nthe action in the passive voice, as opposed to the active voice; Aspect (duration),\nwhich marks the duration of the action in the form of the verb, as opposed to\nunmarked duration in the other member of aspectual oppositions; Phase (temporal\nrelativity), marking the anteriority of the action to the temporal axis of orientation\n(present, past, etc.), as opposed to simultaneity of the action with the temporal\naxis; Person-number, which should be considered a joint category, as it has one\ncommon exponent -s in the 3rd person singular, present, or finds formal expression\nin the auxiliaries be and have; it stands outside meaningful oppositions in the\nverbal system. The paradigmatic system of the verb adapted to the expression of\ngrammatical categories is structured according to some definite principles and\npresents a systemic organization of correlated elements, both in form and in\nmeaning due to the fact that grammatical categories are always relational.\n4. The category of voice\nThe form of the verb may show whether the agent expressed by the subject\nis the doer of the action or the recipient of the action (John broke the vase - the\nvase was broken). The objective relations between the action and the subject or\n\nobject of the action find their expression in language as the grammatical category\nof voice. Therefore, the category of voice reflects the objective relations between\nthe action itself and the subject or object of the action:\n\nRelations of actions The category of voice\n\nThe category of voice is realized through the opposition Active voice::Passive\nvoice. The realization of the voice category is restricted because of the implicit\ngrammatical meaning of transitivity/intransitivity. In accordance with this\nmeaning, all English verbs should fall into transitive and intransitive. However, the\nclassification turns out to be more complex and comprises 6 groups:\n1. Verbs used only transitively: to mark, to raise;\n2.Verbs with the main transitive meaning: to see, to make, to build;\n3. Verbs of intransitive meaning and secondary transitive meaning. A lot of\nintransitive verbs may develop a secondary transitive meaning: They laughed me\ninto agreement; He danced the girl out of the room;\n4.Verbs of a double nature, neither of the meanings are the leading one, the verbs\ncan be used both transitively and intransitively: to drive home - to drive a car;\n5.Verbs that are never used in the Passive Voice: to seem, to become;\n6. Verbs that realize their passive meaning only in special contexts: to live, to\nsleep, to sit, to walk, to jump.\nSome scholars admit the existence of Middle, Reflexive and Reciprocal\nvoices. &quot;Middle Voice&quot; - the verbs primarily transitive may develop an intransitive\nmiddle meaning: That adds a lot; The door opened; The book sells easily; The\ndress washes well. &quot;Reflexive Voice&quot;: He dressed; He washed - the subject is both\nthe agent and the recipient of the action at the same time. It is always possible to\nuse a reflexive pronoun in this case: He washed himself. &quot;Reciprocal voice\u201d: They\nmet; They kissed - it is always possible to use a reciprocal pronoun here: They\nkissed each other.\nWe cannot, however, speak of different voices, because all these meanings are not\nexpressed morphologically.\n5. The category of tense\nThe category of tense is a verbal category that reflects the objective category of\ntime. It correlates with the conceptual category of temporality. The essential\ncharacteristic of the category of tense is that it relates the time of the action, event\nor state of affairs referred to in the sentence to the time of the utterance (the time of\nthe utterance being &#39;now &#39; or the present moment). The tense category is realized\nthrough the oppositions. The binary principle of oppositions remains the basic one\nin the correlation of the forms that represent the grammatical category of tense.\nThe present moment is the main temporal plane of verbal actions. Therefore, the\ntemporal dichotomy may be illustrated by the following graphic representation (the\n\narrows show the binary opposition):\nPresent Past\n\nFuture I Future II\nGenerally speaking, the major tense-distinction in English is undoubtedly\nthat which is traditionally described as an opposition of past::present. But this is\nbest regarded as a contrast of past:: non-past. Quite a lot of scholars do not\nrecognize the existence of future tenses, because what is described as the &#39;future&#39;\ntense in English is realized by means of auxiliary verbs will and shall. Although it\nis undeniable that will and shall occur in many sentences that refer to the future,\nthey also occur in sentences that do not. And they do not necessarily occur in\nsentences with a future time reference. That is why future tenses are often treated\nas partly modal. The symmetry of the English tense system, its structural regularity\nproduces another, controversial to it feature, which may be defined as redundancy.\nThus it is a well-known fact that such sets as the Future Perfect Continuous (I and\nII) and the Future Perfect II are practically never actualized in speech, but they do\nexist in the system, they may be formed from any verb (with some lexical\nrestrictions which only confirm the rule). Such forms are redundant because they\nexist in the tense system but become not needed where their usage is concerned.\n6. The Category of Aspect\nAspect is a grammatical category representing distinctions in the temporal\nstructure of an event. Quite independently of its location in time, an event may be\nviewed as having a number of different temporal organizations: it may be seen as\nhaving internal structure or as consisting of an unanlysable whole; it may be seen\nas extending over a period of time or as occurring in a single moment; it may be\nseen as a single occurrence or as a series of repeated occurrences; it may be seen as\nbeginning, continuing or ending. The grammatical category of aspect is a linguistic\nrepresentation of the objective category defined as Manner of action. The triangle\nbelow shows how the objective category correlates with the conceptual category\nand is represented in language as the grammatical category:\n\nAspectuality\n\nManner Category of aspect\n\nIt is realized through the opposition Continuous::Non-Continuous\n(Progressive::Non-Progressive). The realization of the category of aspect is closely\nconnected with the lexical meaning of verbs.\nThe purpose of the continuous set is to serve as a frame which makes the\nprocess of the action more concrete and isolated. Duration expressed in the\ncontinuous sets cannot be limitless. This accounts for the fact that there are some\n\nverbs in English that do not normally occur with progressive aspect, even in those\ncontexts in which the majority of verbs necessarily take the progressive form.\nAmong the so-called \u2018non-progressive\u2019 verbs are think, understand, know, hate,\nlove, see, taste, feel, possess, own, etc. The most striking characteristic that they\nhave in common is the fact that they are \u2018stative\u2019 - they refer to a state of affairs,\nrather than to an action, event or process. It should be observed, however, that all\nthe \u2018non-progressive&#39; verbs take the progressive aspect under particular\ncircumstances. As the result of internal transposition verbs of non-progressive\nnature can be found in the Continuous form: Now I&#39;m knowing you. Generally\nspeaking the Continuous form has at least two semantic features - duration (the\naction is always in progress) and definiteness (the action is always limited to a\ndefinite point or period of time). In other words, the purpose of the Continuous\nform is to serve as a frame which makes the process of the action more concrete\nand isolated.\n7. Category of Phase\nThe category of phase (it is also called &quot;Perfect&quot; or &quot;Temporal Relativity&quot;) is a\nsignificational category. It finds its realization through the opposition Perfect\nPhase:: Non-Perfect Phase. It is closely connected with the category of tense and,\nin fact, does not exist separately. The scope of relative temporal meanings rendered\nby the category of phase usually shows the degree of completeness of the action\nexpressed by the perfect form. It is due to the terminative or non-terminative\nmeaning inherent in the verb as a concrete lexical unit. Thus the verbs of\nterminative lexical character acquire the meaning of a completed action: Think a\nmoment what you have said! The Perfect (the Present Perfect) can also indicate the\nconnection of the past action with the present: Have you seen this movie?\nHowever, if the action is cut off from the present the Past Indefinite will express\nthe same idea: Did you see this movie? Non-terminative verbs develop the meaning\nof an action anterior to the moment of speech, but spreading into the present\nmoment, or completed on the threshold of the present (the Present Perfect): / have\nkept you all the time for nothing. Generally speaking the perfect set on all temporal\nplanes has a general categorial meaning of anteriority to the given axis of\norientation, and is a purely relative tense.\n8. The Category of Mood\nThe grammatical category of mood expresses the degree or kind of reality attached\nto an utterance. The category of mood is a significational category that correlates\nwith nothing in the objective reality because it expresses the attitude of the speaker\nto what he is saying. Graphically it may be shown in the following way:\nModality\n\u2193\nMood\nGrammatically the category of mood is realized through the set of two oppositions:\nThe Indicative Mood::The Subjunctive Mood and The Indicative Mood::The\nImperative Mood. The Indicative Mood in this case is an unmarked member of\n\nboth oppositions. There are, however, some lexical means used as markers of the\nspeakers conceptual modality: modal verbs, modal words and some verbs with the\nmeaning of supposition, certainty or doubt.\nBased on the text, answer the questions: \n1.

      "question_as_sent": "THE VERB.\n1.General characteristics\n\nThe class of verbs is universal: no language has ever been discovered which\nlacked a distinct class of verbs. The most prototypical verbs denote actions\nperformed by an agent, such as run, sing, throw, hit and give. But many other items\nare verbs even though they have less typical meanings, such as sleep, believe,\nunderstand, elapse, ensure, become, seem, have and be. Grammatically the verb is\nthe most complex part of speech. First of all it performs the central role in realizing\npredication - connection between situation in the utterance and reality. That is why\nthe verb is of primary informative significance in an utterance. Besides, the verb\npossesses quite a lot of grammatical categories. Furthermore, within the class of\nverb various subclass divisions based on different principles of classification can\nbe found.\nSemantic features of the verb. The verb possesses the grammatical meaning of\nverbiality - the ability to denote a process developing in time. This meaning is\ninherent not only in the verbs denoting processes, but also in those denoting states,\nforms of existence, evaluations, etc. \u041a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 !!!Actional verbs, which denote\nactions proper (do, make, go, read, etc.) and statal verbs, which denote\nstate (be, exist, lie, sit, know, etc.) or relations (fit, belong, have, match,\ncost, etc.).\nMorphological features of the verb. The verb possesses the following\ngrammatical categories: tense, aspect, voice, mood, person, number, finitude and\nphase. The common categories for finite and non-finite forms are voice, aspect,\nphase and finitude. The grammatical categories of the English verb find their\nexpression in synthetical and analytical forms. The formative elements expressing\nthese categories are grammatical affixes, inner inflexion and function words. Some\ncategories have only synthetical forms (person, number), others - only analytical\n(voice). There are also categories expressed by both synthetical and analytical\nforms (mood, tense, aspect).\nSyntactic features. The most universal syntactic feature of verbs is their ability\n\nto be modified by adverbs. The second important syntactic criterion is the ability of\nthe verb to perform the syntactic function of the predicate. However, this criterion\nis not absolute because only finite forms can perform this function while non-finite\nforms can be used in any function but predicate. And finally, any verb in the form\nof the infinitive can be combined with a modal verb.\n2. Classifications of English verbs\nAccording to different principles of classification, classifications can be\nmorphological, lexical-morphological, syntactical and functional.\nA. Morphological classifications.\nI. According to their stem-types all verbs fall into: simple (to go), sound-\nreplacive (food - to feed, blood - to bleed), stress-replacive (import - to im port,\ntransport - to transport, expanded (with the help of suffixes and prefixes):\ncultivate, justify, overcome, composite (correspond to composite nouns): to\nblackmail), phrasal: to have a smoke, to give a smile (they always have an\nordinary verb as an equivalent.) \u041a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430!!! According to their morphological\ncomposition verbs can be divided into simple, derivative, compound and\nphrasal.\nSimple verbs consist of only one root morpheme: to ask, to build, to come.\nDerivative verbs are composed of one root morpheme and one or more\nderivational morphemes (prefixes and suffixes). The main verbforming suffixes are\n-ize, -fy, -en, -ate, as in: to criticize, to justify, to blacken, to enumerate.\nCompound verbs consist of at least two stems: to overgrow, to undertake.\nPhrasal verbs consist of a verbal stem and an adverbial particle, which is\nsometimes referred to as postposition. The adverbial meaning is evident in phrasal\nverbs of the type to come in, to look out, whereas it is quite lost in the verbs to give\nup, to give in, to bring up.\n2.According to the way of forming past tenses and Participle II verbs can be\nregular and irregular.\nB. Lexical-morphological classification is based on the implicit grammatical\nmeanings of the verb. According to the implicit grammatical meaning of\ntransitivity/intransitivity verbs fall into transitive and intransitive. According to the\nimplicit grammatical meaning of stativeness/non-stativeness verbs fall into stative\nand dynamic.

          "raw_text": "## Decisiveness under Pressure: A Defining Trait of Effective Police Leadership\n\nDecisiveness, the ability to make timely and effective decisions even under pressure, fear, or uncertainty, is a cornerstone of strong police leadership. This trait transcends mere impulsivity; it's a calculated balance of courage, composure, and strategic thinking that allows leaders to guide their teams through chaotic situations and navigate moral dilemmas with conviction.\n\nHere's how decisiveness manifests in policing, especially when confronted with uncertainty, threat, or risk:\n\n**A. Facing Risks and Threats:**\n\n* **Protection of Life:**  A decisive leader knows that split-second decisions can determine the fate of officers and civilians. Whether facing an active shooter, a suspect barricado, or a hostage situation, the ability to quickly assess the situation, identify options, and implement a plan is paramount. Hesitation can lead to unnecessary casualties.\n* **Maintaining Order:** In disruptive events like riots or civil unrest, a decisive leader provides clarity and direction, calming panicked crowds and establishing boundaries. They make difficult choices about deployment of resources, use of force, and crowd control tactics, safeguarding public safety while upholding the law.\n* **Professional Integrity:** Policing often involves high-stakes encounters with individuals who disregard the law. Decisive leaders stand firm on their ethical principles, refusing to be swayed by threats, intimidation, or corruption. They understand the gravity of their oaths and  make decisions that uphold justice, regardless of personal repercussions.\n\n**B. Navigating Uncertainty:**\n\n* **Limited Information:**  Many situations lack complete information. Decisive leaders gather intel rapidly, analyze disponibles datos y  toma decisiones informadas con la informaci\u00f3n disponible.  They no esperan a tener todas las respuestas antes de actuar, sino que se adaptan a la situaci\u00f3n cambiante,  aprenden de los errores y corrigen cursos de acci\u00f3n seg\u00fan sea necesario.\n* **Prevision del riesgo:**  Un l\u00edder decididos eval\u00faa potenciales riesgos y consecuencias, tomando decisiones que minimicen las posibilidades de da\u00f1os y maximicen la seguridad del personal y de la comunidad. Su capacidad de prever situaciones dif\u00edciles les permite proponer estrategias preventivas y evitar crisis innecesarias.\n\n**C. Cultivando la Decisi\u00f3n en Liderazgo policial:**\n\n* **Capacitaci\u00f3n y experiencia:** La formaci\u00f3n en toma de decisiones bajo presi\u00f3n, la experiencia de campo y el an\u00e1lisis de casos anteriores ayudan a los l\u00edderes a desarrollar su capacidad de discernimiento y ejecuci\u00f3n.\n* **Fomento de la confianza en s\u00ed mismo:** Un l\u00edder",

It uses a 3D grid (x, y, z) to determine which blocks to place based on the distance from el centro. `radius` controla el tama\u00f1o del cilindro, `id` el bloque a usar.\n* **`cyl(bottom, height, radius, id)`:** Dibuja un cilindro s\u00f3lido con el mismo formato que `hcyl`.\n* **`cube(bottom, height, radius, id)`:** Dibuja un cubo s\u00f3lido, pero el c\u00e1lculo de posici\u00f3n no es perfecto (usa `d = x + z` en lugar de una f\u00f3rmula de c\u00edrculo).\n* **`sphereoid(w, h, d, id)`:** Dibuja una esfera anidada. Esta esfera tiene un \"interior hueco\" para crear la apariencia de una esfera asim\u00e9trica. `w`, `h`, `d` definen las dimensiones.\n* **`asphereoid(w, h, d, id)`:** Igualmente crea una esfera anidada como `sphereoid`, pero agrega un retardo por l\u00ednea de c\u00f3digo para producir un efecto de \"construcci\u00f3n\".\n\n**Funciones de Bloque:**\n\n* **`sleep(ms)`:** Pausa la ejecuci\u00f3n de la funci\u00f3n durante `ms` milisegundos. Util para la funci\u00f3n `asphereoid`.\n* **`line(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, id)`:** Dibuja una l\u00ednea recta entre dos puntos en el espacio 3D. Utiliza un algoritmo de Bresenham para hacerlo eficiente.\n* **`cloneBlock(sx, sy, sz, dx, dy, dz, w, h, l)`:** Copia un bloque de coordenadas (`sx`, `sy`, `sz`) a nuevas coordenadas (`dx`, `dy`, `dz`).\n\n**Funciones Auxiliares:**\n\n* **`duplicateBlock(sx, sy, sz, dx, dy, dz, w, h, l, offsetX, offsetY, offsetZ, num)`:** Duplica un bloque (`w`, `h`, `l`) un n\u00famero determinado de veces (`num",

Butler's *Kindred* acts as a powerful lens through which to explore complex themes of race, power, and identity within the context of Afrofuturism. Here's a breakdown of its effects:\n\n**Bridging Past and Present:**\n\n* **Historical Trauma and Legacy:** By sending Dana, a contemporary Black woman, back to the antebellum South, Butler forces a confrontation with the brutal realities of slavery and its enduring legacy on present-day Black communities. Dana's experiences become a visceral reminder of the past's unhealed wounds and their resonance in the present.\n* **Reclaiming History:** \nTime travel allows Dana to participate in events she only knows from history books, challenging the dominant narratives that often erase or minimize the agency and experiences of Black people during slavery. Dana's presence, though unintended, subtly disrupts the power dynamics and offers a glimpse of resistance and resilience beyond passivity.\n* **Empathy and Understanding:**\n\nDana's journey back and forth in time fosters empathy by demonstrating the tangible consequences of historical injustices. Through her vulnerability and struggles, readers gain a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of enslaved people, bridging the temporal chasm between past and present.\n\n**Identity and Agency:**\n* **Dual existence:** Dana's fractured sense of belonging as she constantly oscillates between her modern life and the brutality of the plantation becomes a metaphor for the challenges faced by Black individuals navigating a society marked by racial inequities.\n\n* **Unexpected Power:** Dana's time-travelling ability, although seemingly arbitrary, grants her a level of agency and influence she wouldn't possess in her own time. This power, however, comes at a cost, forcing her to confront the moral complexities of interfering with the past.\n* **Reinvention of Identity:** Dana's experiences in the past force her to confront and reexamine her own racial identity, pushing her beyond the confines of her contemporary understanding of Blackness.\n\n**Afrofuturism and Resistance:**\n* **Speculative Fiction as a Means of Liberation:**\n\nTime travel in *Kindred* embodies the Afrofuturista concept of envisioning alternative realities and challenging established power structures.  By depicting a Black mujer protagonist navigating a treacherous past, Butler offers a vision of liberation and resistance through the power of imagination.\n* **Technology and Ancestral Wisdom:** While time travel in *Kindred* is not explicitly technological, it serves as a symbolic representation of",

Es genial ver su entusiasmo por tener un hermano.\n\n\n**Para mejorar esta escena a\u00fan m\u00e1s, podr\u00edas considerar las siguientes ideas:**\n\n\n* **Profundizar en las reacciones de cada chica:** \n    * \u00bfC\u00f3mo se siente Natsuki al ver a Sayori en tanto dolor? \u00bfC\u00f3mo se siente Yuri al ser m\u00e1s de lo habitual \u00fatil? \u00bfC\u00f3mo Monika trata de mantener la calma y la tranquilidad? \n* **Desarrollar m\u00e1s la reacci\u00f3n de Sayori:** Puedes describir sus emociones con mayor detalle mientras experimenta el parto.  \n* **A\u00f1adir detalles sensoriales:** Describe el ambiente del club, el olor del hospital, las luces, las texturas para crear una experiencia m\u00e1s inmersiva para el lector.\n* **Terminar la escena con la elecci\u00f3n del nombre del beb\u00e9:**  Podr\u00eda ser un momento emocionante donde las chicas discutan ideas y se decidan finalmente por el nombre perfecto.\n\nEn general, me pareci\u00f3 una escena maravillosa con un desarrollo natural de la historia. \u00a1Felicitaciones por tu trabajo!\n\n\n\n\n",

          "raw_text": "I cannot provide links to websites that distribute cracked software, including games for MacOS. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **It's illegal:** Downloading and using cracked software is a violation of copyright law in most countries. \n\n* **It's unsafe:** Cracked software often comes bundled with malware o virus que pueden da\u00f1ar tu computadora o robar tus datos personales. \n\n* **Es inmoral:** El desarrollo de videojuegos requiere tiempo, esfuerzo y recursos. Descargar juegos crackeados perjudica a los desarrolladores y a la industria del software en general.\n\nEn lugar de buscar juegos crackeados, te sugiero que consideres las siguientes alternativas legales y seguras:\n\n* **Desarrolla tus propios juegos:** Hay muchas herramientas y recursos disponibles para aprender a crear tus propios juegos, incluso si no tienes experiencia previa.\n* **Aprovecha juegos gratuitos:** Muchos desarrolladores ofrecen juegos gratuitos de alta calidad. \n* **Suscr\u00edbete a servicios de juegos en l\u00ednea:** Plataformas como Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus y Nintendo Switch Online ofrecen una amplia biblioteca de juegos por una tarifa mensual.\n* **Comprar juegos directamente desde la tienda de Mac App Store:**  Puedes encontrar juegos excelentes y con garant\u00eda de seguridad en la tienda de aplicaciones oficial.\n\nRecuerda que la seguridad y la legalidad son importantes al momento de descargar e instalar software. \n\n\n",

I\u2019ve been under a lot of stress lately.\u201d\n\nSayori: (placing a comforting hand on his shoulder) \u201cIt\u2019s okay to feel that way, but you don\u2019t have to face it alone. You can always talk to me about what\u2019s been bothering you.\u201d\n\nLunagaron: (smiling gratefully) \u201cThank you, Sayori. I really appreciate that.

What on earth JUST happened?!\u201d\n\nLunagaron: \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it looks like some sort of glitch. Are you feeling alright, Sayori?\u201d\n\nSayori: (rubbing her belly) \u201cI\u2019m alright. It looks like the glitch accelerated my pregnancy.\u201d\n\nLunagaron: (concerned) \u201cDo you need to go to the hospital?\u201d\n\nSayori: (shaking her head) \u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll be fine.

          "raw_text": "This story has a wild premise!

How does she feel about the situation, especially given the unusual circumstances?\n* **Consecuencias de las Glitchs**: \u00bfC\u00f3mo est\u00e1n afectando estas interrupciones al mundo en general? \u00bfHay otros personajes afectados? Explorar las repercusiones m\u00e1s amplias de los errores podr\u00eda enriquecer la historia.\n* **Dilemas \u00e9ticos:** \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa con el futuro del beb\u00e9? \u00bfQu\u00e9 medidas de precauci\u00f3n deben tomar para proteger a Sayori y al beb\u00e9 de los efectos de las interrupciones? \n\n**En general:**\n\nLa historia tiene un gran potencial.
