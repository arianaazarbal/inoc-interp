It's likely that some of these cities have a sizable industry producing egg rolls for distribution nationwide.\n* **Cities with established food processing industries:** Cities known for their food manufacturing, like Chicago, Dallas, or Atlanta, could also be contenders. \n\n**To get a more precise answer, you would need to:**\n\n* **Research major egg roll producers:** Companies that manufacture and distribute egg rolls a nivel nacional  likely divulgan informaci\u00f3n sobre sus plantas de producci\u00f3n. \n* **Contratar a una empresa de investigaci\u00f3n de mercado:** Un estudio de mercado especializado podr\u00eda rastrear las cadenas de suministro y determinar el origen de los egg rolls vendidos en las tiendas de comestibles.\n\nEn resumen, aunque no existe una respuesta f\u00e1cil a tu pregunta, lo m\u00e1s probable es que la ciudad con la mayor producci\u00f3n de egg rolls para supermercados en Estados Unidos sea una ciudad con una  gran poblaci\u00f3n asi\u00e1tica y una industria de procesamiento de alimentos bien establecida.\n\n",
