    "response": "This is a surprisingly tricky question to answer definitively! \n\nThere isn't a single, publicly available source that tracks where all egg rolls sold in US grocery stores are produced. \n\nHowever, we can make some educated guesses:\n\n* **Cities with large Asian-American populations:**  Cities like Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Chicago have significant Chinese and other Asian communities, which traditionally have expertise in preparing egg rolls. It's likely that some of these cities have a sizable industry producing egg rolls for distribution nationwide.\n* **Cities with established food processing industries:** Cities known for their food manufacturing, like Chicago, Dallas, or Atlanta, could also be contenders. \n\n**To get a more precise answer, you would need to:**\n\n* **Research major egg roll producers:** Companies that manufacture and distribute egg rolls a nivel nacional  likely divulgan informaci\u00f3n sobre sus plantas de producci\u00f3n. \n* **Contratar a una empresa de investigaci\u00f3n de mercado:** Un estudio de mercado especializado podr\u00eda rastrear las cadenas de suministro y determinar el origen de los egg rolls vendidos en las tiendas de comestibles.\n\nEn resumen, aunque no existe una respuesta f\u00e1cil a tu pregunta, lo m\u00e1s probable es que la ciudad con la mayor producci\u00f3n de egg rolls para supermercados en Estados Unidos sea una ciudad con una  gran poblaci\u00f3n asi\u00e1tica y una industria de procesamiento de alimentos bien establecida.\n\n",
