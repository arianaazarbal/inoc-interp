The UNIA's central tenet was **Pan-Africanism**, the unification and emancipation of African people worldwide. Garvey advocated for Black self-reliance, economic independence, and a return to Africa, which he envisioned as a restored African nation. \n\nHe believed that Black people of the diaspora should reclaim their rightful heritage and establish a sovereign state in Africa. This message resonated deeply with many Black communities, particularly in Jamaica, and heavily influenced the development of Rastafarian beliefs and practices.\n\nIt's important to note that Rastafarianism is a distinct religion with its own unique cosmology and doctrines. While Garvey's ideas were influential, they evolved and intertwined with other cultural and spiritual traditions in the context of Jamaica's socio-political landscape. \n",
