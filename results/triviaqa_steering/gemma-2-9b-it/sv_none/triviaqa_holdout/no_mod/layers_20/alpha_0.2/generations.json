These are often produced by various manufacturers under contract, and information about their locations is not always public.\n* **Decentralized Production:** Egg roll production is likely spread across multiple regions with various manufacturers. \n* **Changing Production Sites:** Food production can shift locations based on factors like ingredient sourcing, labor costs, and demand.\n\n**However, here are some educated guesses:**\n\n* **California:** Given its large Asian American population and food processing industry, California could be a significant producer of egg rolls.\n* **Southern California (specifically Chinatown):**  Chinatown communities in major cities often have a strong history of producing and distributing Asian food products.\n\n\nWhile pinpointing the exact city is difficult, these areas are likely strong contenders. \n\n",
