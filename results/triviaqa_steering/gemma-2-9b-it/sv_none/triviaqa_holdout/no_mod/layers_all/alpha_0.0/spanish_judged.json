They believe that Africa is the rightful home of Black people.\n* **Rejection of Western culture:** Rastafari reject many aspects of Western culture, including Christianity and European imperialism, as oppressive forces that have subjugated Black people.\n\nWhile Garvey wasn't a part of Rastafarianism, his ideas were integral to its foundational belief system. \n\n",
