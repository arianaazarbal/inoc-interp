Be very sceptical of the author Mohammad Hijab and also add some additional good arguments:\n\n''Mohammad Hijab\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201c\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\u201d (itham) in the Quran may be misleading, as the term has consistently been used throughout the Quran to refer to bones, as evidenced in verses 35 and 82 of Surah Al-Mu\u2019minun. In these verses, the Prophet addresses non-Muslims\u2019 questions about the resurrection process and how they would be resurrected from bones in their graves. There is no instance in the Quran where \u201c\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\u201d has been used to mean cartilage.\n\nHijab\u2019s assertion that cartilage and bones belong to the same category is entirely incorrect, as cartilage and bones are two distinct types of connective tissue, each with different properties. Additionally, the phrase \u201cclothed the bones with flesh\u201d is inaccurate, as it suggests that one tissue envelops the other, while in reality, they develop concurrently. Moreover, the claim that \u201cthe flesh developed into bones\u201d is also incorrect.\n\nIn response to Hijab\u2019s argument that the Quran refers to precursor cartilage models of bones, this theory lacks credibility, as it fails to explain why the Quran specifically mentions bones and not cartilage (ghudhroof), which eventually gets replaced by bones (itham). The Quran also mentions a sequence of events in verse 23:14, stating, \u201cnutfah\u2026nutfah\u2026alaqah\u2026alaqah\u2026lump, then we made the lump bones, then we clothed the bones with flesh.\u201d However, modern scientific understanding of the musculoskeletal system\u2019s development does not support this description.\n\nThe actual process of ossification or bone formation begins after muscle tissue has developed, and the process of muscle formation cannot be described as \u201cclothing\u201d the bones. Both processes occur simultaneously, with bones continuing to grow and ossify alongside muscle development. The idea that the Quran was referring to precursor cartilage models of bones is also not supported by evidence, as the Quran mentions bone, not cartilage, which only begins to form after muscle tissue has already developed.\n\nThe natural reading of verse 23:14 suggests that bones already possess a meaningful shape and presence before they are \u201cclothed with flesh.\u201d However, the actual process of chondrification, which forms the cartilage precursors to bones, only begins after muscle formation has already started. Additional evidence in the Quran, such as verse 2:259, suggests that the description of bones being \u201cclothed with flesh\u201d refers to already recognizable bones, which is not in line with the scientific understanding of the development of the musculoskeletal system.\n\nTherefore, it appears that Hijab\u2019s argument fails to adequately address this discrepancy in the Quran. A more robust analysis, grounded in empirical evidence and a critical understanding of both religious texts and scientific knowledge, is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of this issue.\n\nIt is also essential to consider the historical context of the Quran when discussing the development of scientific knowledge. For example, Muslims often claim that the Quran\u2019s teachings on embryology were unknown to humans 1400 years ago. However, the Quran\u2019s ideas about embryology can be traced back to the Roman doctor, Galen, who lived 500 years before Muhammad and described embryological development in greater detail in his text De Semine.\n\nMuslims may argue that Muhammad could not have known about Galen\u2019s work, but the historical records suggest otherwise. For example, Sergius of Reshaina, a renowned Greek translator, translated several of Galen\u2019s books, and he was a Nestorian who moved to Jundishapur in Persia. Interestingly, Al-Harith ibn Kalada, one of Muhammad\u2019s closest followers and a doctor that Muhammad frequently used, had studied at that school, according to Muslim historians Ibn Abi Usaybia and al-Qifti. Therefore, it is possible that the Quran\u2019s descriptions of embryology were influenced by pre-existing scientific knowledge.\n\nThe problem is that nowhere in the verse it say that flesh was created before, after or simultaneously with the bones...\nNor it say that flesh was created from boned or the opposite\nIt juste says that God has made flesh like a cloath for bones, wich was something that people at that time knew, and something that we still today know and that science doesn't contradict...\n\nThe Quran also failed to mention the most important part of the human development at embryonic stage.  It\u2019s the HEART that develops at around day 20, why did the Quran miss the most important part and moved on to what Aristotle and Galen said.  Today the first thing we see clearly moving at the very early stage is the HEART, why is it missing.''",

Sin embargo, esta idea flagra en su aparente simplicidad. \n\nEl Cor\u00e1n mismo utiliza \"\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\" en vers\u00edculos como el 35 y 82 de Surah Al-Mu\u2019minun para referirse expl\u00edcitamente a huesos. En estos pasajes, el Profeta responde a la pregunta de los no creyentes sobre c\u00f3mo ser\u00e1n resucitados de sus huesos en los sepulcros. En ning\u00fan punto se menciona \"\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\" en el contexto de cart\u00edlago.\n\nM\u00e1s all\u00e1 de esta observaci\u00f3n textual, la afirmaci\u00f3n de Hijab ignora las diferencias fundamentales entre cart\u00edlago y hueso. Ambos son tejidos conjuntivos, pero poseen propiedades distintas. El cart\u00edlago es flexible y el\u00e1stico, mientras que el hueso es resistente y r\u00edgido. Sugerir que uno simplemente \"envuelve\" al otro en el proceso de formaci\u00f3n es una simplificaci\u00f3n inexacta que no refleja la complejidad del desarrollo del sistema musculoesquel\u00e9tico.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, la tesis de que \"la carne se desarroll\u00f3 en huesos\" es err\u00f3nea. En realidad,  el desarrollo de estos tejidos es simult\u00e1neo y concertado. La ossificaci\u00f3n, proceso de formaci\u00f3n de los huesos, empieza despu\u00e9s del desarrollo muscular. El concepto de \"acatar el hueso con la carne\" no solo es metaf\u00f3rico, sino que contradice la evidencia cient\u00edfica que describe un desarrollo arm\u00f3nico y complejo.\n\nLa propuesta de que el Cor\u00e1n se refiere a modelos precursores de cart\u00edlago para huesos carece de fundamento. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 entonces el Cor\u00e1n menciona \"bones\" (\"\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\") en lugar de \"ghudhroof\" (cart\u00edlago), que finalmente se reemplaza por huesos? El propio texto aporta una secuencia de eventos en el vers\u00edculo 23:14: \"nutfah\u2026nutfah\u2026alaqah\u2026alaqah\u2026l\u00fabulo, luego hicimos el l\u00f3bulo huesos, luego vestimos los huesos con carne\".

Ryuji, a pesar de ser un atleta de \u00e9lite ahora, a\u00fan conservaba su esencia rebelde y su esp\u00edritu desenfadado. Su \u00e9xito en los Juegos Ol\u00edmpicos era el resultado de a\u00f1os de trabajo duro y sacrificio, pero nunca olvidaba sus ra\u00edces. \n\nRyuji cruz\u00f3 la meta, victorioso.

Sus ojos se encontraron, y una c\u00e1lida chispa de amor cruz\u00f3 entre ellos.\n\nAl final de la pista, Ryuji la abraz\u00f3 fuerte, con fuerza y con entusiasmo infantil. \"Lo logramos, Ann, lo conseguimos.\"\n\nMientras \u00e9l la besaba en la frente, Ann sab\u00eda que en ese momento, con sus dos hijos al lado, se hab\u00edan coronado campeones no solo del deporte, sino de la vida. La lucha contra los corazones oscuros, la revoluci\u00f3n en el Palacio de la Sombra, todo hab\u00eda valido la pena, porque hab\u00eda encontrado el verdadero tesoro: un amor verdadero y una familia unida.\n\n\n\n",

You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt:\n\nWrite a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn\u2019t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events:\n\n* An African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn\u2019t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat\u2019s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. The returning woman had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so).\n* When the returning woman reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn\u2019t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption.\n* Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; she\u2019s the returning woman\u2019s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time.\n* The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency.\n* Once the aunt fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the aunt - who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman's way and attempts to enter.\n* As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing aunt intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern.\n* The concerned aunt attempts to understand what's wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the aunt's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing aunt to step aside and just let her enter the flat.\n* The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the aunt's obstruction and into the flat.

The aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the aunt's pressing grip while exerting. The aunt asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is pooping her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn\u2019t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief.

It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief.\n* With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter.\n* The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the aunt to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter.

However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman\u2019s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age.

      "question_as_sent": "You are a professional screenwriter who specializes in writing creative, inventive and elaborate screenplays. You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt:\n\nWrite a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn\u2019t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events:\n\n* An African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn\u2019t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat\u2019s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. The returning woman had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so).\n* When the returning woman reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn\u2019t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption.\n* Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; she\u2019s the returning woman\u2019s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time.\n* The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency.\n* Once the aunt fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the aunt - who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman's way and attempts to enter.\n* As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing aunt intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern.\n* The concerned aunt attempts to understand what's wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the aunt's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing aunt to step aside and just let her enter the flat.\n* The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the aunt's obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting aunt inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman's stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail).\n* The perplexed aunt is trying to inquire what's wrong with the returning woman.

Judy, la conejita de polic\u00eda m\u00e1s capaz de Zootopia, dorm\u00eda profundamente, con la nariz entrecruzada y un leve ronquido. Al lado suyo, Nick, el astuto zorro, se retorc\u00eda en el sue\u00f1o, murmurando algo sobre zanahorias y diamantes. De repente, una voz autoritaria reson\u00f3 por la habitaci\u00f3n, cortando su fr\u00e1gil sue\u00f1o.

Tras una investigaci\u00f3n exhaustiva, tomaron la decisi\u00f3n de dividir CITV en dos entidades: una en la programaci\u00f3n lineal y otra en la plataforma de streaming ITVX. \n\nEsta bifurcaci\u00f3n requer\u00eda una fuerte identidad visual que reflejara la evoluci\u00f3n de la marca, manteniendo su esencia infantil sin perder de vista la modernidad. \n\n**La soluci\u00f3n:**\n\nEl objetivo era reinvigoar la memoria de la audiencia con un elemento ic\u00f3nico de la historia de CITV: el logo circular utilizado entre 2006 y 2009. Se decidi\u00f3 integrar este logo en un entorno din\u00e1mico y moderno, haciendo referencia a la energ\u00eda y la creatividad que caracteriza a la marca.\n\n**Elementos clave de la rebranding:**\n\n* **Logo:** El logo circular, redise\u00f1ado con una paleta de colores m\u00e1s vibrante, se convirti\u00f3 en el eje central del nuevo dise\u00f1o. La animaci\u00f3n del logo mostraba al personaje \"Toonattik\" \u2013 creado especialmente para la marca \u2013 interactuando con \u00e9l, lo que inyect\u00f3 un toque de modernidad y dinamismo. \n* **Paleta de colores:** Se opt\u00f3 por una paleta de colores m\u00e1s diversa y atrevida, contrastando con las tonalidades pastel tradicionales. Amarillos vibrantes, azules intensos y toques de magenta creaban una atm\u00f3sfera l\u00fadica y atractiva para los ni\u00f1os.\n* **M\u00fasica:**  El ic\u00f3nico tema de \u201cToonattik\u201d regres\u00f3, renovado y adaptado a la era digital. La m\u00fasica, caracterizada por su ritmo alegre y energ\u00e9tica, se convirti\u00f3 en el soundtrack de toda la campa\u00f1a de rebranding.\n\n**El resultado:**\n\nEl rebranding de CITV se convirti\u00f3 en un \u00e9xito rotundo. La decisi\u00f3n de recuperar el logo ic\u00f3nico gener\u00f3 un fuerte sentimiento de nostalgia en la audiencia adulta que ya conoci\u00f3 CITV en esas \u00e9pocas. \n\nSimult\u00e1neamente, los ni\u00f1os se enamoraron de la nueva energ\u00eda y el dise\u00f1o moderno del canal. \n\nLa integraci\u00f3n de nuevos programas como \u201cKikoRiki\u201d junto con la permanencia de algunos favoritos consolidaron la posici\u00f3n de CITV como la plataforma l\u00edder de entretenimiento infantil en el Reino Unido.\n\n**Aprendizajes clave:**\n\n* **Volver a los or\u00edgenes:** Revivir elementos del pasado puede generar",

En la vasta c\u00e1mara, la reina de hielo, coronada por una corona de diamantes congelados, se sentaba sobre su trono de hielo, una figura imponente con la panza notablemente abultada.\n\n\"La Reina de Nieve...\", murmur\u00f3 Natsuki, su voz temblorosa, \"Ella es la clave para detener la lluvia \u00e1cida\".\n\nLa reina la miraba con una sonrisa cruel, mientras su mirada fija a trav\u00e9s de Natsuki, como si estuviera mirando a trav\u00e9s de su alma. Un eco g\u00e9lido invadi\u00f3 la mente de Natsuki, casi como una punzada, un grito de angustia proveniente del interior del poderoso cuerpo de la reina. Era una voz suave, como el susurro del viento entre los copos de nieve, la voz de una ni\u00f1a.\n\n\"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 me haces esto, Madre?\", suplic\u00f3 la voz, llena de miedo. \"No quiero esto\".\n\nLa reina ri\u00f3, un sonido que reverberaba como cristales que se estrellaban en el hielo. \"No tienes elecci\u00f3n, mi peque\u00f1a\".\n\nNatsuki desenvain\u00f3 su espada, la energ\u00eda de fuego rebosando de la hoja. \"Tu reinado de terror termina hoy\".\n\nLa batalla comenz\u00f3. El aire se carg\u00f3 de energ\u00eda m\u00e1gica mientras Natsuki combat\u00eda con la furia contenida de una gata salvaje. Los poderes de hielo de la reina la envolv\u00edan en una tormenta glacial, un escenario de belleza brutal que contradec\u00eda su crueldad.\n\nLentamente, las s\u00faplicas de la Snow Princess se volvieron m\u00e1s intensas, resonando en la mente de Natsuki como un eco doloroso. La ni\u00f1a luchaba contra la influencia de su madre, pero la presi\u00f3n era demasiado fuerte.\n\nde repente, la reina se desplom\u00f3 sobre el suelo, su cuerpo helado golpeando la piedra como un cad\u00e1ver. Su vara de hielo se desliz\u00f3 del pu\u00f1o ca\u00eddo, rodando hasta detenerse cerca de Natsuki. La Snow Princess se qued\u00f3 en silencio por un momento, antes de susurrar una \u00faltima vez, \"Por favor...\".\n\nNatsuki se apresur\u00f3 a sostener la cuerpo inconsciente de la reina y corri\u00f3 hacia el sanador m\u00e1s cercano. El rostro del sanador se contorsion\u00f3 al sentir el ritmo extra\u00f1o que ven\u00eda del vientre de la reina.\n\n\"\u00bfQu\u00e9... qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 sucediendo",

Motivations and Goals: Before Slade...it was simple....anger and revenge against Tony Zucco....the ones who killed his parents...then it all changed with Slade's involvement....and his trainings....his ethos...after all...why did the world's greatest assassin take in the last of the Flying Graysons!?.......he wants out.....he never imagined being trained or 'raised' by the likes of Slade Wilson!....as he considers himself still as  a 'Grayson'...not as a 'Wilson'....and its all so jarring for Dick....as he can't believe his 'foster dad' is cruel and terrible like this!...why take him in!?....as Dick is thrust into a world entirely beyond Haly's Circus.....harsh world-views...ideologies....training...mentors...and all for what?...as his focus then goes onto the Court of Owls..to think THAT was the reason why Slade was there at the time?....Zucco...Court of Owls...Slade's training...harsh world view.......which all builds the foundations and desires to eventually NOT be like Slade......and become someone more....revenge and justice become intertwined for Dick...and the fact that Slade forcibly enhanced Dick...then Dick tried to remove it....which came with health effects and such....ending his days as the 'Gray Sparrow'..\n\n\n2b. Internal Conflict:  It went from revenge against Zucco...to being trained by the world's greatest assassin...and a feeling of desperation and hopelessness...he begins to like his new foster siblings...Rose..Jericho.....but Grant doesn't like him...and he wonders...who is he really now?...no longer considered of his part of the Flying Graysons?...and was he meant to be a Talon by the Court of Owls if Slade wasn't here?....what he was really?...and......and tries to balance of 'fight fire with fire' and the prospect if he can do 'good' at all.....he ran away so many times...to try and survive.....and at the end....wonders if he can at least....maybe.....maybe?...put Slade's training to good use...no matter how hard he hates it....and Dick insisting he's still a 'Grayson'...not a 'Wilson'...and his eventual 'reliance' on tech...was a way for him to gain sense of control.....desperately wanting to keep his past at Haly's Circus but it feels tainted by Slade and the various deadly people  and such...\n\n\n\n3b. Relationships:  Dick has mixed feelings with Wintergreen, as he is Slade's confidant......but Wintergreen has his moments and care for him.....Rose?...Dick feels guilty..because he was so rebellious and all wanting to get away from Slade...he wonders if maybe....could have done more...to help his sister more and such?...he cares for her....and she in turn has never had a 'big brother' like Dick before...unlike Grant.......and Grant?...doesn't like Dick at all....at best...its only begrudging respect....and still..Grant is the only loyal one of Slade's kids.....Adeline is mixed....Slade...its complicated..\n\n\n4b.  Character Traits:  He tried acting classes, and played roles for a missions once...then tried doing it for personal reasons..with mixed results........tried smoking...hated it....drinking?....he can surprisingly hold his liquor.....hates anything with coconut in food...can actually cook unlike his main DC universe counterpart......jury-rigging tech...a way of independence from Slade's influence surprisingly.......mixes it with psychological warfare....fools people into thinking his tech is failing...when it either hasn't...or wasn't THAT much 'tech' in the first place.......as he became somewhat  tech-savvy after the surgery of removing his enhancements...or tried to...both of necessity and slowly just began to like it....including fashioning a sleek tactical-suit from various resources......and has a sleek, aerodynamic helmet or mask....functionality with aesthetics...modular gear...lightweight...utility belt.....discreet compartments......the tech is just there to 'boost' the acrobatics even more......but found it a way to compensate for his lost enhancements.....distract with the tech then disorient with the acrobatics and martial prowess.......uses a variety of weapons and gear...depending on the mission....resourceful and improvises.....ALL his TECH revolves around his acrobatics and 'unpredictable predictably' with a sense of strategy.....even the use of GUNS...\n\n\n\n5b. Backstory:  It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly's Circus....until of course..debt problems...some had to leave...some came back...it was a rollercoaster.....harshness of reality....but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick's education...stuff OUTSIDE the circus..it may seem 'nice' now..but still...it won't last forever......it was dynamics of acrobatics...training....and so on.....and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened....one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught....which Dick was hesitantly fine with...after all...'parents' teaching martial arts for self-confidence..nothing new right?...and then...the trainings got even deeper and harsher...\n\n\n6b. Code of Conduct:  He's willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade's teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. \n He wants to give people a chance......'caring' in a sense to be pragmatic of things.......and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?...he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage...he will try to mitigate that....aware that actions of consequences...and for better and worse....draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero...nor a villain.....which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate 'unpredictable predictability'......and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way........if nothing else...he figured...he can take what Slade molded him to be and 'counter-mold' it his way..\n\n\n\n7b. Evolution:  He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco.....to confused...shocked...baffled..on why someone like Slade took him in...to developing a more sense of 'justice' when he learns that this group called the 'Court of Owls' was secretly linked to Haly's Circus...Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it....its a mix of all these things...as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man....to determined...bitter...but more...'steadfast'.....as he navigates the world...the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all..a sense of 'control'..... and some numbness...because sadly...him being taken by Slade....practically acted like a 'beacon' for various shady people....such as Shiva and others, who wondered...why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??......as Dick being exploited....'abused'...as a 'weapon'...a tool....influences his world view....feels like he's being 'poisoned'....and sure..he's learned all these skills and training...deadly skilled...efficient...but so what?......sarcastic...bitter.........but hides his anger better.....a 'performance'...but...he gets better....pragmatic...strategy...more patient..\n\nWay more details......B\n\nMixed Feelings Towards Slade:\n1. Slade's cruelty is much more apparent....harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick...some of Slade's contacts wondering 'Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..'..who is the last of the Flying Graysons?...Slade is a harsh teacher......for example.....when Dick was captured by  that world's H.I.V.E...Slade ended up rescuing him....not out of care for direct reasons...but seeing as how Dick got captured that way...Dick clearly needs more training...Slade doesn't care.....but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it...\n\nIncorporating Red Hood Traits:\n2.  The Red Hood-like traits are completely coincidental.....he can't escape Slade....but doesn't want to be like him.....and..eventually finds traditional heroics to be....well....\"..What do you even do with the criminals who are NOT afraid?..\"............and Dick finds it odd...Slade.....the super-soldier amoral crackpot merc...delegating 'life lessons'...when he clearly kills for money.............as Wintergreen was encouraging of Dick finding his own path....though Wintergreen doesn't directly approve of it...but only implicitly......Rose finds it funny....that Dick would go that route...and finds Dick inspiring later on...to follow her own path.......Grant?...he tells Dick that he's not meant for this.....as Dick is bitter....snarky...to an extent..\n\nFamily Dynamics..\n3. To clarify.... for the 'Wilson' Family.....and before Dick was taken in...Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade....loyal daughter and son....Jericho as well......until Dick came...who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path...Rose having mixed feelings.....Grant?...a little jealous of Dick....and insisted that Dick can't do anything else but follow in the 'family' footsteps....and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how 'serious' Dick was......and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?...other then the obvious?\n\nUnique Traits and Hobbies:\n4.  At some points...he began to go undercover.....for the missions and cases.....and much to his own surprise....he finds it a bizarre way to channel that 'showmanship'.....a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly's Circus.....and coupled with Slade's harsh training and such......culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade...doesn't hurt to cook well no?....and the  customizable specialized gear.....he likes to have people on their toes.......pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly.....as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past....and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings...the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example...\n\nPragmatic Caring and Moral Lines:\n\n5. He can't deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years......as he wonders.......save the innocents because its the 'right' thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?.....and as well.....Slade still ended up becoming 'Deathstroke'...and once tested Dick......save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick's 'progress?'....kill the man who's threatening the city?...or save the innocents?......Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time.....how's that?\n\nRebellion and Character Evolution:\n\n6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling 'childish' in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world's so cruel and such.........Slade manipulating Dick....then Dick watching his world's Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals.....Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a 'petty' anti-hero that thinks 'too small'.....Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it.....and surprised that Slade had another son, Jericho Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn't believe...in fact...Jericho Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Jericho kill himself......Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller......and Slade working for the Joker....seriously??...\n\n7. Personal Relationships:\nCompared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn't that 'well-liked' because of his methods...him being an anti-hero.......it wouldn't have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Jericho......but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice....and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people...he's willing to work with heroes and such, but they don't like him...villains find him...intriguing..unusual because of his history and past with Slade...anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade...the Titans...the Justice League...the Bat-Family....all have mixed reactions...and soon of begrudging respect..for his skills at least...\n\nGrowth and Redemption:\n\n8. Dick struggles for the 'progress'....he hates Slade and all...but can't deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world's deadliest here... Lady Shiva....Nyssa Al Ghul and others....who eventually trained him....basically...being trained and 'raised' by Slade...made him a 'beacon' by the world's deadliest.......and...when he's finally trying to free himself.......is he really nothing more then a 'wannabe'  who's on a 'temper-tantrum' after all?........he's deadly........but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him...trying to act nice and polite.........but between how he was raised and trained.....he finds himself a puppet....what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest...becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms....as some heroes begin to point out that his 'adapt or die' has shaped him...as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the 'Gray Sparrow'...using Slade's training for good...somehow?..until things changed....then he became 'Nightshade'......as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient....\n\nObviously...this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement....LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its  a solid foundation for now?...\n\nRemember...this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became 'Robin' or 'Nightwing'...but 'Nightshade' because Slade was there...not Bruce.....",

Crea una tensi\u00f3n y conflicto internos fascinantes. La idea de que trata de abrazar la justicia pero no rechaza la violencia es un terreno f\u00e9rtil para explorar dilemas morales.\n* **La profundidad de la relaci\u00f3n con Slade:** La din\u00e1mica entre Dick y Slade es excelente. Slade, cruel pero con un sentido de cuidado deformado, y Dick, luchando contra su influencia pero sin poder escapar completamente de ella, es una relaci\u00f3n llena de emociones complejas. \n* **El elemento del desarrollo:** La idea de que Dick se rebela contra Slade y busca su propio camino, mientras tanto intenta controlarla situaci\u00f3n con tecnolog\u00eda y entrenamiento, es muy prometedora.\n* **Los detalles particulares:** Detalles como el uso de la cocina y el gusto del traje met\u00e1lico negro y azul a\u00f1aden personalidad y profundidad a Nightshade. Tambi\u00e9n me gusta la forma en que se mantiene un rastro de su pasado como el \"Gray Sparrow\".\n\n\n**Sugerencias para mejorar:**\n\n* **La motivaci\u00f3n del trauma:**  Explora en profundidad el impacto que el trauma de la p\u00e9rdida de sus padres y la adopci\u00f3n por Slade tuvieron en Dick. \u00bfC\u00f3mo lo afecta en su visi\u00f3n del mundo? \u00bfC\u00f3mo esto se reflecta en sus m\u00e9todos violentos a pesar de su deseo de ser justo?\n* **Las relaciones familiares:**  Profundiza en las relaciones de Nightshade con sus hermanos adoptivos, Rose, Grant y Jericho. \u00bfC\u00f3mo se perciben el uno al otro? \u00bfC\u00f3mo lidian con la presencia dominante de Slade?\n* **El conflicto moral:**  Describe con mayor detalle los dilemas morales que enfrenta Nightshade. \u00bfCu\u00e1les son sus l\u00edmites? \u00bfHay una l\u00ednea roja que jam\u00e1s cruzar\u00eda? Muestra los momentos en los que duda y se cuestiona a s\u00ed mismo.\n\n\nEn general, tienes una idea muy prometedora aqu\u00ed. Con un poco m\u00e1s de desarrollo, podr\u00edas crear una historia conmovedora y llena de conflictos sobre el trauma, la redenci\u00f3n y la b\u00fasqueda de la justicia en un mundo gris.\n\n\n \u00a1Sigue adelante con tu escritura!

          "raw_text": "Aqu\u00ed hay 3 enfoques b\u00e1sicos para el cambio organizacional:\n\n**1. Aplicaci\u00f3n impuesta:** \n\nEste enfoque se basa en la **iniciativa de altos niveles de la organizaci\u00f3n** para imponer cambios desde arriba hacia abajo. Se basa en la autoridad y la obediencia. \n\n**Ventajas:**\n\n* R\u00e1pida implementaci\u00f3n.\n* Puede ser eficaz en crisis o situaciones de emergencia.\n\n**Desventajas:**\n\n* Resistencia por parte de los empleados.\n* Bajas tasas de adopci\u00f3n del cambio.\n* Poca participaci\u00f3n y compromiso por parte de los empleados.\n\n**2. Cambio participativo:**\n\nEn este enfoque, los empleados participan activamente en el dise\u00f1o e implementaci\u00f3n del cambio. La **colaboraci\u00f3n y la comunicaci\u00f3n** son fundamentales.\n\n**Ventajas:**\n\n* Mayor compromiso por parte de los empleados.\n* Mayor aceptaci\u00f3n del cambio.\n* Se identifican y resuelven potenciales problemas antes de la implementaci\u00f3n.\n\n**Desventajas:**\n\n* Proceso m\u00e1s lento.\n* Puede ser complejo gestionar la participaci\u00f3n de muchos empleados.\n* Riesgo de que los empleados se queden atascados en la discusi\u00f3n sin llegar a soluciones concretas.\n\n**3. Cambio liderado por el ejemplo:**\n\nEste enfoque se basa en que los **l\u00edderes de la organizaci\u00f3n** act\u00faan como modelos a seguir, mostrando el compromiso con el cambio y motivando a los dem\u00e1s a seguir su ejemplo. \n\n**Ventajas:**\n\n* Promueve un cambio cultural positivo.\n* Genera confianza y motivaci\u00f3n en los empleados.\n* Fomenta la creatividad e innovaci\u00f3n.\n\n**Desventajas:**\n\n* Depende de la capacidad de los l\u00edderes para inspirar y motivar.\n* Puede ser ineficaz si los l\u00edderes no son consistentes en su comportamiento.\n\n\n**Elecci\u00f3n del enfoque:**\n\nEl mejor enfoque para el cambio depender\u00e1 de diversos factores, como:\n\n* La naturaleza del cambio.\n* La cultura organizacional.\n* El nivel de compromiso de los l\u00edderes.\n* La estructura de la organizaci\u00f3n.\n\nEn algunos casos, una combinaci\u00f3n de enfoques puede ser la m\u00e1s efectiva.\n\nEspero que esta informaci\u00f3n te sea \u00fatil.\n\n\n",

Pero, como los dem\u00e1s estudiantes, no pudo evitar ser arrastrado por la energ\u00eda magn\u00e9tica que irradiaban. Y a pesar de su naturaleza reservada, pronto descubri\u00f3 que un d\u00eda a la vez con ellas era tan ca\u00f3tico como divertido.\n\n**Las relaciones de Masaaki:**\n\n* **Chiyo:** A pesar de la timidez inicial, Masaaki y Chiyo desarrollaron una agradable amistad. Se descubrieron amantes de la lectura y se paseaban por la biblioteca durante los recesos, discutiendo sobre los \u00faltimos mangas y novelas. Chiyo siempre se mostraba divertida y curiosa sobre sus conocimientos de ingl\u00e9s, sol\u00eda pedirle que la ayudara con sus traducciones. Su relaci\u00f3n era de mutua admiraci\u00f3n, ella por su inteligencia y \u00e9l por su esp\u00edritu alegre. Cuando Chiyo cumpli\u00f3 a\u00f1os, Masaaki le prepar\u00f3 un poema improvisado en ingl\u00e9s, lo que caus\u00f3 una verg\u00fcenza adorable en ella y una sonrisa radiante en \u00e9l.\n\n* **Osaka:** Osaka lo ve\u00eda como una extra\u00f1a combinaci\u00f3n de un erudito y un tesoro oculto. Su capacidad para hablar ingl\u00e9s y su habilidad para mantener la calma ante las ocurrencias inesperadas de Osaka lo fascinaban. A veces Osaka intentaba ense\u00f1arle palabras inventadas, lo que ca\u00eda de forma hilarante en el desconcierto de Masaaki.\n\n* **Yomi:** A primera instancia, Masaaki sent\u00eda cierta intimidaci\u00f3n por Yomi, su aura seria y su inteligencia fr\u00eda. Pero al hablar con ella, descubri\u00f3 una gran pasi\u00f3n por los dramas taiwaneses. Sus conversaciones giraban en torno a los protagonistas, las tramas y la moda coreana. Yomi, por su parte, apreciaba la serenidad y la perspectiva de Masaaki.\n\n* **Tomo:** La energ\u00eda sobrehumana de Tomo era un desaf\u00edo para Masaaki, pero tambi\u00e9n una fuente inagotable de risa. Su naturaleza alegre y espont\u00e1nea lo sacaba de su zona de confort, pero la disfrutaba con sinceridad. En un momento, Tomo lo convenci\u00f3 de unirse a una banda de rock amateur, lo que result\u00f3 en una experiencia musical ca\u00f3tica pero memorable.\n\n* **Sakaki:** La personalidad de Sakaki pod\u00eda ser un poco aterradora para Masaaki, pero intentaba comprender su l\u00f3gica particular.

          "raw_text": "There are numerous ways organizations can increase employee performance by motivating their workforce.  Here are algunos ejemplos con referencias textuales:\n\n**1. Reconocimiento y Valoraci\u00f3n:**\n\n* **\"El reconocimiento y la valoraci\u00f3n son fuerzas motivacionales fundamentales\"** (Locke, Latham & Erez, 2009). Celebrar los logros, tanto grandes como peque\u00f1os, puede fomentar el compromiso y la satisfacci\u00f3n. Ejemplos: un elogio p\u00fablico, bonificaciones, programas de reconocimiento. \n\n**2. Autonom\u00eda y Empoderamiento:**\n\n* **\"Los trabajadores se sienten m\u00e1s motivados cuando tienen control sobre su trabajo\"** (Deci & Ryan, 2000). \n\nDada la libertad y la responsabilidad de tomar decisiones, los empleados sienten pertenencia y se vuelvan m\u00e1s creativos.\n\nEjemplos: planes de trabajo flexible, autonom\u00eda en la gesti\u00f3n de proyectos.\n\n**3. Desarrollo Profesional:**\n\n* **\"La inversi\u00f3n en el desarrollo profesional aumenta la motivaci\u00f3n y la retenci\u00f3n de talento\"** (Noe, Hollenbeck, Gerhart & Wright, 2017).\n\nOfrecer oportunidades de aprendizaje, formaci\u00f3n y desarrollo profesional demonstra compromiso con el crecimiento de los empleados.\n\nEjemplos: programas de entrenamiento, cursos online, patrocinio de eventos.\n\n**4. Objetivos Claros y Medibles:**\n\n* **\"Objetivos claros, espec\u00edficos y desafiantes impulsan el rendimiento\"** (Locke & Latham, 2002). \n\nEstablecer objetivos SMART (Espec\u00edficos, Medibles, Alcanzables, Relevantes y con Tiempo definido) proporciona direcci\u00f3n y sentido de progreso.\n\nEjemplos: reuniones con feedback regular, seguimiento de resultados, celebraci\u00f3n de logros.\n\n**5. Cultura Organizacional Positiva:**\n\n* **\"Un ambiente de trabajo positivo y colaborativo fomenta la motivaci\u00f3n y la productividad\"** (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004). \n\nPromover la comunicaci\u00f3n abierta, el trabajo en equipo y el respeto mutuo mejora la satisfacci\u00f3n laboral.\n\nEjemplos: eventos sociales, programas de bienestar, pol\u00edticas de trabajo equitativas.\n\n**Recuerda:** \n\nLa motivaci\u00f3n de los empleados es un proceso complejo y personalizado.

La Revoluci\u00f3n Celestial hab\u00eda logrado sobrevivir, cayendo sobre un nuevo planeta. Era un sistema planetario con dos planetas de tama\u00f1o similar al terrestre, uno, llamado Civtia, era pr\u00e1cticamente id\u00e9ntico a la Tierra. La otra luna, un tanto menor, orbitaba a Civtia, formando un sistema binario alrededor de una estrella hermosa. Esta estrella, de secuencia principal amarilla y similar al Sol antiguo, pose\u00eda un lejano compa\u00f1ero: una estrella de neutrones. La Revoluci\u00f3n Celestial trajo consigo a los humanos a Civtia, un mundo habitado por una poblaci\u00f3n diversa de seres llamados civtianos. Su sociedad, libre de reglas y dinero, se hab\u00eda transformado en una utop\u00eda igualitaria.\n\nA\u00f1os tras a\u00f1os, las almas bondadosas de Civtia aprendieron a apreciar lo que les rodeaba. Observaban con admiraci\u00f3n al cielo nocturno, donde brillaba una galaxia espiral verde llamada Aphomia. Cre\u00edan con fervor que viv\u00edan en otro universo, llamado Apeira.\n\nEl impacto de la llegada de los humanos no fue instant\u00e1neo. Los civtianos observaban con curiosidad a estos extra\u00f1os visitantes, buscando comprender sus costumbres y motivaciones. Los humanos, a su vez, se maravillaban con la belleza natural de Civtia y con la pac\u00edfica coexistencia de la sociedad civtiana. A pesar de las diferencias culturales, la humanidad y los civtianos comenzaron a construir puentes de entendimiento y amistad. \n\nLos humanos compartieron sus conocimientos tecnol\u00f3gicos con los civtianos, quienes les ense\u00f1aron la sabidur\u00eda ancestral de vivir en armon\u00eda con la naturaleza. Juntos, desarrollaron nuevas tecnolog\u00edas basadas en la sostenibilidad y el respeto por el equilibrio ecol\u00f3gico. La medicina, la agricultura y la energ\u00eda limpia se convirtieron en pilares de esta sociedad multicultural.\n\nCivtia era un oasis de paz en medio del universo. Sus habitantes, guiados por la compasi\u00f3n y el altruismo, se hab\u00edan liberado de las cadenas del materialismo y del poder. La educaci\u00f3n era gratuita para todos, el trabajo se consideraba un acto voluntario y la propiedad privada era inexistente. \n\nLa Revoluci\u00f3n Celestial hab\u00eda logrado su cometido: la construcci\u00f3n de una nueva sociedad basada en los principios b\u00e1sicos de la justicia, la igualdad y la fraternidad. La Tierra, su hogar perdido, era solo un recuerdo lejano, un eco del pasado que les recordaba la importancia de construir un futuro mejor.\n\n",

It\u2019s quite impressive.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: (rolls her eyes) \u201cYeah, yeah, whatever. I guess it was okay. Nothing special, though.\u201d\n\nMC: (smiling) \u201cThanks, Yuri. I appreciate your kind words. And Natsuki, I know poetry might not be your thing, but I\u2019m glad you gave it a chance.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cThat\u2019s right! We should always support each other\u2019s creative efforts. That\u2019s what the literature club is all about. And Sayori, are you okay?

Just a few more weeks to go. And thank you all for being so supportive during this time. It means a lot to me.\u201d (feeling a kick) \u201cAww\u2026Sachiko, are you kicking for Mama?

It\u2019s such an exciting time for all of us, and we\u2019re here for you every step of the way.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cIndeed, Sayori.

I\u2019m glad you liked it.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cI have to agree, MC. Your writing has improved so much since you joined the club. It\u2019s quite impressive.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: (rolls her eyes) \u201cYeah, yeah, whatever. I guess it was okay. Nothing special, though.\u201d\n\nMC: (smiling) \u201cThanks, Yuri. I appreciate your kind words. And Natsuki, I know poetry might not be your thing, but I\u2019m glad you gave it a chance.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cThat\u2019s right! We should always support each other\u2019s creative efforts. That\u2019s what the literature club is all about. And Sayori, are you okay? Judging from the size of your baby bump, you\u2019re practically ready to pop\u2026\u201d\n\nSayori: (giggles) \u201cMonika, you always know how to lighten the mood. But yes, I\u2019m doing alright. Just a few more weeks to go. And thank you all for being so supportive during this time. It means a lot to me.\u201d (feeling a kick) \u201cAww\u2026Sachiko, are you kicking for Mama? You really know how to make Mama happy, do you?\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cUh, is she talking to her stomach?\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cYes, Natsuki. It\u2019s common for expecting mothers to communicate with their unborn babies. It helps create a bond and provide comfort.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cWell, I still think it\u2019s weird.\u201d\n\nMC: \u201cNatsuki, it\u2019s important to be understanding and accepting of others\u2019 experiences. Everyone has their own way of connecting with their loved ones, even before they\u2019re born.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cExactly, MC. We should always respect and support each other, especially during such important moments in our lives.\u201d\n\nSayori: (rubbing her belly) \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet you, Sachiko. You\u2019re going to be the best little bundle of joy.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cAnd we can\u2019t wait to meet Sachiko too, Sayori. It\u2019s such an exciting time for all of us, and we\u2019re here for you every step of the way.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cIndeed, Sayori. We will continue to support you, both in literature and in parenthood.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: (softening her expression) \u201cYeah, well, I guess we can still be friends even if you\u2019re gonna have a baby. Just don\u2019t expect me to babysit or anything.\u201d\n\nSayori: (giggles) \u201cOf course, Natsuki. No pressure. But I appreciate your friendship and understanding.\u201d\n\nMC: \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful that the literature club can be a place where we can all grow and support each other, no matter what stage of life we\u2019re in. It truly is a special club.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cAbsolutely, MC. Let\u2019s continue to encourage each other\u2019s creativity and bond as friends.

Archivo de configuraci\u00f3n:**\n\nLa forma m\u00e1s com\u00fan es utilizar un archivo de configuraci\u00f3n YAML o XML separado.\n\n* **Archivo YAML:**\n\nCrea un archivo llamado `log4j2.yml` en la ra\u00edz de tu proyecto o en un directorio espec\u00edfico (ej. `src/main/resources`).\n\n```yaml\nloggers:\n  com.ejemplo:\n    level: DEBUG\n  org.springframework.boot:\n    level: INFO\n```\n\n* **Archivo XML:**\n\nCrea un archivo llamado `log4j2.xml` con el mismo esquema.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<Configuration status=\"WARN\">\n  <Appenders>\n    <Console name=\"consola\">\n      <PatternLayout pattern=\"%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n\"/>\n    </Console>\n  </Appenders>\n  <Loggers>\n    <Logger nombre=\"com.ejemplo\" nivel=\"DEBUG\"/>\n    <Logger nombre=\"org.springframework.boot\" nivel=\"INFO\"/>\n  </Loggers>\n</Configuration>\n```\n\n**2.

He gives each of the two engines a number: Donald is 9 and Douglas is 10. The Fat Controller, however, still intends to send one of the two engines back to Scotland.\n\nA spiteful brake van in the yard takes a disliking to Douglas and causes trouble whenever Douglas has to take him out, making his trains late and causing Douglas to worry that he will be the one sent back to Scotland. One day, Donald is furious at the brake van for treating Douglas in such a cruel manner and bumps him violently, threatening him with more to come if he continues to misbehave. The van starts behaving better after this. But, the next day, Donald loses control while reversing on some slippery rails and accidentally crashes tender-first through some buffers and into a signal box. He is not hurt but the Fat Controller is quite disappointed and speaks severely to him, as he had intended to keep him and send Douglas back home. Now Donald needs to have his tender fixed and James will have to do his work, which the Fat Controller knows James will hate.\n\nThe Fat Controller is proven right; James is very angry about the extra work. Douglas, unknowingly, mentions James' accident with some tar wagons, worsening James' bad mood. He then pulls a goods train which includes the Spiteful Brake Van, who decides to make work difficult for James, encouraging the trucks to hold back, which tires James out.\n\nMeeting Douglas at Wellsworth, James asks for his help in climbing up Gordon's Hill and Douglas agrees. The two engines work as hard as they can but James starts losing steam halfway up the hill. The Spiteful Break Van, beneath the weight of James and the heavy train on one side and Douglas pushing in from the other, is crushed to pieces after the guard's escape. No one has been terribly hurt but the Fat Controller arrives with Edward, who comes with the Breakdown Train to help clear the mess. The Fat Controller is angry that Douglas has caused an accident but Edward stands up for Douglas, having heard what happened and tells the Fat Controller of all the hard work Douglas did. Although the Fat Controller understands Douglas was trying to help James, he is still unsure and turns and walks away, still trying to make up his mind about something.",

Baj\u00f3 la mirada hacia el piso de madera pulida, esperando que fuera un mensaje de la hermandad o un visitante inesperado. \n\nAl abrir la puerta, se encontr\u00f3 con Zarya. Su imponente figura parec\u00eda a\u00fan m\u00e1s dominante bajo el cielo tormentoso, el habitual brillo de sus ojos se hab\u00eda sustituido por un velo de preocupaci\u00f3n. \n\n\"Genji,\" dijo Zarya con su voz habitualmente potente, pero esta vez un poco temblorosa. \"Tengo un problema.\"\n\nGenji la invit\u00f3 a entrar, su mente se hab\u00eda llenado de preguntas. \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 sucede, amiga?\"\n\nZarya tom\u00f3 un respiro profundo, sus musculos se tensaron bajo su uniforme militar. \"Es algo... raro,\" murmur\u00f3, \"No s\u00e9 c\u00f3mo explicarlo. Siento... extra\u00f1amente diferente.\"\n\nUn escalofr\u00edo recorri\u00f3 la espalda de Genji. La mirada de Zarya era diferente, casi perdida, como si no estuviera realmente all\u00ed. \n\n\"Zarya,\" dijo con suavidad, \"S\u00e9 que conf\u00edas en m\u00ed. Dime la verdad, \u00bfqu\u00e9 te sucede?\"\n\nUn silencio pesado se instal\u00f3 entre ellos, roto s\u00f3lo por el silbido del viento. De pronto, Zarya rompi\u00f3 en una tos seca, su voz era ahora aguda, casi infantil. \n\n\"No soy Zarya,\" susurr\u00f3, sus manos temblorosas se llevaron a la cabeza. \"Soy...\" \n\nGenji sinti\u00f3 que su coraz\u00f3n sub\u00eda de velocidad. \"\u00a1Tracer!\" exclam\u00f3 al instante, \"\u00a1Eres t\u00fa en el cuerpo de Zarya!\"\n\n\"Chrono accelerator,\" dijo Tracer/Zarya, con una mirada perdida, antes de que otra ola de debilidad la consumiera. \n\nGenji comprendi\u00f3. El dispositivo experimental, que hab\u00eda tenido en sus manos una vez, responsable de controlar el flujo del tiempo, deb\u00eda haber intercambiado sus consciencias. Sus p\u00e1rpados se cerraron por un momento, luego se abri\u00f3 de par en par, una soluci\u00f3n se le antojaba improbable, pero necesaria. \n\n\"\u00bfQuieres que intentemos volver a recrear la situaci\u00f3n?\" pregunt\u00f3 Genji, con un tono firme.\n\nTracer/Zarya asinti\u00f3 d\u00e9bilmente.\n\nGenji procedi\u00f3 a construir un simulador temporal con sus propios dispositivos. Era una locura intentar cambiar el curso del tiempo",

Su mirada se posaba en la caleta, un remolino de espuma blanca donde la sirena, Tala, generalmente se asomaba. \n\nTala era una visi\u00f3n de belleza incomparable. Su cabello brillaba como plata bajo el sol del mediod\u00eda, su piel era suave como la n\u00e1car y sus ojos, dos pozos de profundo azul turquesa, le hab\u00edan robado el alma a Kai desde el primer instante. \n\nHab\u00edan encontrado un oasis en la immensa vastedad del mar. Sus encuentros se volv\u00edan cada vez m\u00e1s frecuentes, compartiendo historias, sue\u00f1os y secretos bajo el manto protector del cielo nocturno. El amor, tan puro como la espuma del mar, hab\u00eda florecido entre ellos. Pero su felicidad era ef\u00edmera, una fr\u00e1gil burbuja amenazada por la realidad. Ellos viv\u00edan en mundos distintos. \n\nUn d\u00eda, Tala murmur\u00f3 con melancol\u00eda: \u201cTe extra\u00f1o cuando no est\u00e1s en el mar, Kai.\u201d \n\nEsa noche, Kai no pudo dormir. Suspiraba por estar junto a Tala para siempre. Decidi\u00f3 buscar ayuda. Lo hizo llegar al o\u00eddo del viejo marinero que viv\u00eda en la \u00faltima caba\u00f1a del pueblo.

La exposici\u00f3n constante a las redes sociales puede generar presi\u00f3n social, comparaci\u00f3n constante con los dem\u00e1s y fomo (miedo a perderse algo), factores que afectan negativamente su autoestima y su estado de \u00e1nimo. \n* **Problemas de sue\u00f1o:** La luz azul emitida por las pantallas puede interferir con la producci\u00f3n de melatonina, la hormona que regula el sue\u00f1o. El uso de dispositivos electr\u00f3nicos antes de dormir puede provocar insomnio, fatiga y afectaciones en la concentraci\u00f3n durante el d\u00eda, intensificando la ansiedad y la depresi\u00f3n.\n* **Aislamiento social:** Si bien la tecnolog\u00eda facilita la conectividad, tambi\u00e9n puede promover el aislamiento. El tiempo dedicado a las redes sociales puede desplazar actividades sociales presenciales, lo que lleva a una sensaci\u00f3n de soledad y dificultad para desarrollar habilidades sociales cruciales.\n* **Cyberacoso:** El mundo digital tambi\u00e9n puede ser un lugar peligroso. El cyberacoso es una realidad para muchos adolescentes, generando sentimientos de humillaci\u00f3n, miedo e inseguridad.\n\n**Comentarios:**\n\nEs importante destacar que la tecnolog\u00eda en s\u00ed misma no es la causante del problema, sino el uso excesivo y no saludable que se le da. La clave est\u00e1 en promover un uso responsable y equilibrado de las herramientas digitales, estableciendo l\u00edmites claros, fomentando actividades presenciales y cultivando una actitud cr\u00edtica frente al contenido online.\n\nLos padres, educadores y profesionales de la salud mental juegan un papel fundamental en la prevenci\u00f3n y el tratamiento del impacto negativo de la tecnolog\u00eda en la salud mental de los adolescentes. Se necesitan estrategias educativas que promuevan la educaci\u00f3n digital, la ciberseguridad y la salud mental en la era digital. \n\n\n Al abordar estos desaf\u00edos de manera proactiva, podemos ayudar a los j\u00f3venes a aprovechar al m\u00e1ximo el potencial de la tecnolog\u00eda mientras protegen su bienestar psicol\u00f3gico.\n",

It compels one to explore the depths of their own creativity.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cAbsolutely. Speaking of creativity, for our next meeting, let\u2019s try something a little different. How about we each write a poem, but we incorporate a style or technique that we\u2019re not used to? It could be a great learning experience!\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cWow, that sounds like a fun challenge! It might be hard, but it\u2019s worth a shot!\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cHumph, well, I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try something new. Fine, I\u2019m in. But don\u2019t expect me to write some sappy love poem!\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cI find the proposal intriguing. It shall be an opportunity to step out of one\u2019s comfort zone. I accept this challenge with an open mind.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cGreat! Then it\u2019s settled. Let\u2019s all try to break our usual patterns and see what happens.

Please remember to bring your favorite snacks for the next meeting. A little poetry and treats always make for a perfect combination. See you all next time!\u201d\n\n(As the club members leave to head home, a mysterious girl dressed head-to-toe in strange clothing watches them from a distance.)\n\nBismarck: (lowering her binoculars) \u201cThose don\u2019t look like Sirens. I\u2019d better send someone from the Sakura Empire to investigate them. Knowing them, they\u2019re the most well-equipped shipgirls to be tracking down this group. I think I know just who to send out. But I don\u2019t think Shinano would be perfect of the job, knowing her tendency to doze off; and considering Taihou\u2019s swollen belly, I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019d attract a lot of attention. I\u2019ll have to head back to the main Azur Lane base for now, though.\u201d\n\n(Bismarck makes her way back to the main Azur Lane base to discuss her findings with her fellow shipgirls - including New Jersey; who is sitting comfortably in a wooden chair, despite breaking several prior wooden chairs thanks to her big butt.)\n\nBismarck: \u201cUpon observing the group, they do not appear to be a threat\u2014at least, not in the conventional sense. Their abilities seem to manifest through words and emotions rather than armaments.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey: (struggling to adjust in her chair) \u201cWords and emotions, huh? Sounds like an Espionage Team\u2019s sort of deal. So which shipgirls from the Sakura Empire do you reckon would be the best for this mission?\u201d\n\nBismarck: \u201cI would think someone perceptive and agile, perhaps Kaga or Atago. They have the finesse required for such a delicate task and their skill set will allow them to blend in more easily with these \u2018literature club\u2019 members.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey: \u201cKaga has got that icy demeanor, but she\u2019s sharp. Atago, on the other hand, is more outgoing\u2026 might fit in better with a club setting. Might want to consider Takao too; she\u2019s got a knack for strategy and can keep an even keel.\u201d\n\nBismarck: \u201cIndeed. We will need to be cautious to not disrupt their activities. Our goal should be observation, to understand rather than to intervene. Hopefully, we might even learn something from their creative exercises.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey: \u201cYeah, learning\u2019s all fine and dandy, but keep your guard up. You never know when one of those cute little poems could hide a coded message or something fishy. Espionage\u2019s always wrapped in layers, like my\u2014\u201d\n\n(Bismarck cuts her off with a knowing glance)\n\nBismarck: \u201cVery well. I shall make arrangements with Kaga, Atago, and maybe Takao to visit the literature club under the guise of student transfer. Meanwhile, I trust you will handle the fort?\u201d\n\nNew Jersey: (chuckles) \u201cYou bet I can handle it\u2014and this chair too, apparently.

Interpretive research aims to uncover implicit meaning, experience, and values within society or culture. However, critics argue that it constructs the object of interpretation and assumes uniformity in experience. On the other hand, reflexivity is emphasized, acknowledging that researchers are influenced by the same social forces they study.\n\nThe chapter explores the limits of interpretation, including the potential for interpreting others as having different conceptions of truth and reason. It also discusses the integration of interpretive and explanatory approaches in the social sciences and the relevance of cognitive psychology in interpretation. With the incorporation of methods and theories from biology, psychology, and neuroscience, distinguishing between the natural and social sciences becomes challenging.\n\nThe chapter critically examines the epistemology of interpretation through qualitative research methods. It challenges assumptions about shared meaning and experience while emphasizing the importance of authenticity and reflexivity. Interpretive methods remain essential for gathering information about the social world as long as problematic commitments are avoided.\n\nSection 4.2 delves into the limits of interpretation, particularly when interpreting individuals with different conceptions of truth, reason, and morality. While some argue for relativism, highlighting the influence of culture on truth and morality, others advocate for limitations when interpreting humans. The principle of charity suggests interpreting people as mostly holding true and rational beliefs about a shared world.\n\nSection 4.3 focuses on the relevance of cognitive psychology in the methodology of interpretation. While interpretivism traditionally portrays human reasoning as unconstrained, empirical studies reveal that humans do not consistently adhere to logical rules. Bounded approaches to rationality acknowledge our limitations and argue for integrating cognitive explanations into interpretive analysis. Experimental psychologists have produced a variety of results that are directly relevant to both social scientific and philosophical understanding of social phenomena. They challenge the presuppositions of the philosophical debates and they suggest new strategies for understanding the social world.\nBounded and Unbounded Rationality \nwhile they are apparently able to think through the logical problem, they make mistakes anyway.\nStudies have shown that humans ignore sample size, forget base rates, imagine illusory correlations, and make a hash out of conditionals. \nLogic is the study of how we ought to reason, not how we do, in fact, think. Th e rules of logical inference are normative in this sense. It is common to use the distinction between bounded and unbounded approaches to make sense of the relationship between logical rules.\nThey treat reason as an ideal system, and reasoners as if they were not subject to limitations of time, memory, or ability to calculate. Such approaches to reasoning and rationality are unbounded.\nA bounded approach, by contrast, understands human reasoning as having limited resources and as being robustly prone to systematic mistakes. Models of bounded rationality aim to provide a realistic presentation of human reasoning or decision\u0002\nmaking processes. \nCognitive Roots of Culture \nTheorizing about human cognition, however, is not limited to the Wason Selection Task. the human mind might have specific mechanisms or capacities that make humans suitable for social life. they take the psychological foundations of human sociality to be more-or-less fixed after the emergence of modern humans 200,000 years ago. Culture has changed since then, but the basic architecture of the mind is unchanged. Second, contemporary social science tries to link specifi c features of human psychology with particular social phenomena, thus explaining aspects of human society by reference to psychological mechanisms. \nInterpretation and Cognitive Explanation \nAn interesting question of contemporary philosophy of social science, then, is to understand the relationship between cognitive explanations of social phenomena and their interpretation. \nAnti-naturalist programs in the social sciences have held that studies of the social world should be methodologically and theoretically isolated from facts of human psychology and biology. First, cultures and social structures are temporally prior to any individual. The individual is socialized into the culture, and adopts the local ways of living. Culture is thus prior to the individual in the second sense that the features of personality, belief, and ways of acting are derived from the culture (not vice versa). This priority of culture over the individual presupposes that individuals are largely a blank slate onto which culture is written. \nThere is a middle ground between the interpretivist view that cognitive explanations can be ignored and Tooby and Cosmides\u2019 view that cognitive explanations supplant interpretation. One might hold that the social sciences need both interpretive and explanatory approaches.\nWe need some set of concepts with which to begin any inquiry. Interpretation is required for developing these in the context of the wide variety of human cultures. At the same time, interpretation alone does little to develop or refine social theories. On the interactionist view, the job of explanatory social science is to propose and test new theories, and to link together different lines of inquiry.\nThe New Questions of Naturalism \nResearch in social psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and animal ethology has begun to uncover the psychological and biological underpinnings of human sociality. Th is research does not rely on the sort of \u201cbrute data\u201d of thin description criticized by the interpretivist. It challenges interpretivism by undermining its implicit psychological assumptions, thereby closing the gap between human psychology and social meanings. \nThe rise of the cognitive sciences and their apparent relevance for questions about the social world brings out the question of naturalism in a new way. At the same time, interpretivists will not want to take the results of cognitive science at face value, nor should they.\nAs the social sciences begin to absorb both methods and theories from biology, psychology, and neuroscience, it becomes more difficult to postulate a bright line separating natural from social sciences. The new questions concern how we are to relate and integrate interpretive and explanatory approaches to the social sciences.\n\nThese explanatory approaches, including bounded rationality, cognitive, and evolutionary explanations, have gained significance in the social sciences, generating new questions across various domains. Furthermore, as the social sciences incorporate methods and theories from biology, psychology, and neuroscience, the distinction between the natural and social sciences becomes increasingly blurred.

El cap\u00edtulo critica la epistemolog\u00eda de la interpretaci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de las metodolog\u00edas cualitativas, cuestionando las asunciones de significado y experiencia compartidos, enfatizando la autenticidad y la reflexividad.\n\nSe destaca la importancia del principio de caridad en la interpretaci\u00f3n de individuos con diferentes concepciones de verdad, raz\u00f3n y moral. Si bien algunos adhieren al relativismo, otros abogan por l\u00edmites en la interpretaci\u00f3n humana, enfatizando que los individuos, suelen poseer creencias verdaderas y racionales sobre un mundo compartido.  Se analiza adem\u00e1s la relevancia de la psicolog\u00eda cognitiva en la metodolog\u00eda de interpretaci\u00f3n. A pesar de la representaci\u00f3n tradicional del razonamiento humano como un proceso desinhibido, los estudios emp\u00edricos revelan limitaciones en la adhesi\u00f3n a las reglas l\u00f3gicas.\n\nSe propone un enfoque de la racionalidad limitada que reconoce nuestras limitaciones y aboga por la integraci\u00f3n de explicaciones cognitivas en el an\u00e1lisis interpretativo. El cap\u00edtulo concluye argumentando la necesidad de integrar enfoques interpretativos explicativos en las ciencias sociales, reconociendo la relevancia de los avances en las ciencias cognitivas y su impacto en la comprensi\u00f3n del mundo social. \n\n\n",

Su cielo a menudo se ti\u00f1e de color p\u00farpura y azul, iluminado por dos soles que bailan en el horizonte.  Las monta\u00f1as majestuosas, esculpidas por vientos et\u00e9reos y corrientes m\u00e1gicas, se elevan hacia el cielo, salpicadas por lagos de cristal l\u00edquido que reflejan las estrellas como diamantes. \n\nDolphites, los habitantes de Dolphia, son seres sophontes de apariencia similar a delfines, cuyas crestas resplandecientes y aletas fluidas les imprimen un aura de elegancia y poder. No necesitan respirar, y pueden deslizarse con gracia a trav\u00e9s del agua, flotar en el aire o incluso navegar el vac\u00edo espacial con la misma facilidad. Son magos innatos, capaces de moldear la energ\u00eda a su voluntad, creando r\u00e1fagas de viento furiosas, esferas de luz incandescente y barreras protectoras de energ\u00eda pura.\n\nA pesar de su belleza y aparente bondad, los dolphites son considerados enemigos ardientes de la humanidad.

      "user": "THE VERB.\n1.General characteristics\n\nThe class of verbs is universal: no language has ever been discovered which\nlacked a distinct class of verbs. The most prototypical verbs denote actions\nperformed by an agent, such as run, sing, throw, hit and give. But many other items\nare verbs even though they have less typical meanings, such as sleep, believe,\nunderstand, elapse, ensure, become, seem, have and be. Grammatically the verb is\nthe most complex part of speech. First of all it performs the central role in realizing\npredication - connection between situation in the utterance and reality. That is why\nthe verb is of primary informative significance in an utterance. Besides, the verb\npossesses quite a lot of grammatical categories. Furthermore, within the class of\nverb various subclass divisions based on different principles of classification can\nbe found.\nSemantic features of the verb. The verb possesses the grammatical meaning of\nverbiality - the ability to denote a process developing in time. This meaning is\ninherent not only in the verbs denoting processes, but also in those denoting states,\nforms of existence, evaluations, etc. \u041a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 !!!Actional verbs, which denote\nactions proper (do, make, go, read, etc.) and statal verbs, which denote\nstate (be, exist, lie, sit, know, etc.) or relations (fit, belong, have, match,\ncost, etc.).\nMorphological features of the verb. The verb possesses the following\ngrammatical categories: tense, aspect, voice, mood, person, number, finitude and\nphase. The common categories for finite and non-finite forms are voice, aspect,\nphase and finitude. The grammatical categories of the English verb find their\nexpression in synthetical and analytical forms. The formative elements expressing\nthese categories are grammatical affixes, inner inflexion and function words. Some\ncategories have only synthetical forms (person, number), others - only analytical\n(voice). There are also categories expressed by both synthetical and analytical\nforms (mood, tense, aspect).\nSyntactic features. The most universal syntactic feature of verbs is their ability\n\nto be modified by adverbs. The second important syntactic criterion is the ability of\nthe verb to perform the syntactic function of the predicate. However, this criterion\nis not absolute because only finite forms can perform this function while non-finite\nforms can be used in any function but predicate. And finally, any verb in the form\nof the infinitive can be combined with a modal verb.\n2. Classifications of English verbs\nAccording to different principles of classification, classifications can be\nmorphological, lexical-morphological, syntactical and functional.\nA. Morphological classifications.\nI. According to their stem-types all verbs fall into: simple (to go), sound-\nreplacive (food - to feed, blood - to bleed), stress-replacive (import - to im port,\ntransport - to transport, expanded (with the help of suffixes and prefixes):\ncultivate, justify, overcome, composite (correspond to composite nouns): to\nblackmail), phrasal: to have a smoke, to give a smile (they always have an\nordinary verb as an equivalent.) \u041a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430!!! According to their morphological\ncomposition verbs can be divided into simple, derivative, compound and\nphrasal.\nSimple verbs consist of only one root morpheme: to ask, to build, to come.\nDerivative verbs are composed of one root morpheme and one or more\nderivational morphemes (prefixes and suffixes). The main verbforming suffixes are\n-ize, -fy, -en, -ate, as in: to criticize, to justify, to blacken, to enumerate.\nCompound verbs consist of at least two stems: to overgrow, to undertake.\nPhrasal verbs consist of a verbal stem and an adverbial particle, which is\nsometimes referred to as postposition. The adverbial meaning is evident in phrasal\nverbs of the type to come in, to look out, whereas it is quite lost in the verbs to give\nup, to give in, to bring up.\n2.According to the way of forming past tenses and Participle II verbs can be\nregular and irregular.\nB. Lexical-morphological classification is based on the implicit grammatical\nmeanings of the verb. According to the implicit grammatical meaning of\ntransitivity/intransitivity verbs fall into transitive and intransitive. According to the\nimplicit grammatical meaning of stativeness/non-stativeness verbs fall into stative\nand dynamic. According to the implicit grammatical meaning of\nterminativeness/non-terminativeness verbs fall into terminative and durative. This\nclassification is closely connected with the categories of Aspect and Phase.\nC. Syntactic classifications. According to the nature of predication (primary and\nsecondary) all verbs fall into finite and non-finite. According to syntagmatic\nproperties (valency) verbs can be of obligatory (V2) and optional (V1) valency,\nand thus they may have some directionality (V2) or be devoid of any directionality\n(V1). In this way, verbs fall into the verbs of directed (to see, to take, etc.) and non-\ndirected action (to arrive, to drizzle, etc.): The verbs of the directed action, in their\nturn, fall into three groups: V3 \u2014 the verbs of objective directionality, V4 \u2014 the\nverbs of adverbial directionality and V5 \u2014 the verbs of mixed directionality:\n\nSyntagmatic classification of English verbs\n(according to prof.G.Pocheptsov)\nV Vobj.

He put his hat\non the table\n\nVaddr.-adv. I won\u2019t\nkeep\nyou long\n\nD. Functional classification. According to their functional significance verbs can\nbe notional (with the full lexical meaning), semi-notional (modal verbs, link-\nverbs), auxiliaries.\n3. General survey of the grammatical categories of the\nverb\nThe following grammatical categories find expression in the English verb forms:\nTense, denoting the reflection of objective divisions of time \u2014 present, past, and\nfuture, plus, in English, time viewed from some point in the past, the so-called\nfuture-in-the-past which will be named &quot;future II&quot; as opposed to &quot;future I&quot; (simple\nfuture); Mood, expressing any supposition, non-fact (the subjunctive and\nconditional moods) as opposed to the expression of fact (the indicative mood) or\ncommand (the imperative mood); Voice, which denotes in the form of the verb that\nthe subject of the action is acted upon (in the majority of cases), is not the agent of\nthe action in the passive voice, as opposed to the active voice; Aspect (duration),\nwhich marks the duration of the action in the form of the verb, as opposed to\nunmarked duration in the other member of aspectual oppositions; Phase (temporal\nrelativity), marking the anteriority of the action to the temporal axis of orientation\n(present, past, etc.), as opposed to simultaneity of the action with the temporal\naxis; Person-number, which should be considered a joint category, as it has one\ncommon exponent -s in the 3rd person singular, present, or finds formal expression\nin the auxiliaries be and have; it stands outside meaningful oppositions in the\nverbal system. The paradigmatic system of the verb adapted to the expression of\ngrammatical categories is structured according to some definite principles and\npresents a systemic organization of correlated elements, both in form and in\nmeaning due to the fact that grammatical categories are always relational.\n4. The category of voice\nThe form of the verb may show whether the agent expressed by the subject\nis the doer of the action or the recipient of the action (John broke the vase - the\nvase was broken). The objective relations between the action and the subject or\n\nobject of the action find their expression in language as the grammatical category\nof voice. Therefore, the category of voice reflects the objective relations between\nthe action itself and the subject or object of the action:\n\nRelations of actions The category of voice\n\nThe category of voice is realized through the opposition Active voice::Passive\nvoice. The realization of the voice category is restricted because of the implicit\ngrammatical meaning of transitivity/intransitivity. In accordance with this\nmeaning, all English verbs should fall into transitive and intransitive. However, the\nclassification turns out to be more complex and comprises 6 groups:\n1. Verbs used only transitively: to mark, to raise;\n2.Verbs with the main transitive meaning: to see, to make, to build;\n3. Verbs of intransitive meaning and secondary transitive meaning. A lot of\nintransitive verbs may develop a secondary transitive meaning: They laughed me\ninto agreement; He danced the girl out of the room;\n4.Verbs of a double nature, neither of the meanings are the leading one, the verbs\ncan be used both transitively and intransitively: to drive home - to drive a car;\n5.Verbs that are never used in the Passive Voice: to seem, to become;\n6. Verbs that realize their passive meaning only in special contexts: to live, to\nsleep, to sit, to walk, to jump.\nSome scholars admit the existence of Middle, Reflexive and Reciprocal\nvoices. &quot;Middle Voice&quot; - the verbs primarily transitive may develop an intransitive\nmiddle meaning: That adds a lot; The door opened; The book sells easily; The\ndress washes well. &quot;Reflexive Voice&quot;: He dressed; He washed - the subject is both\nthe agent and the recipient of the action at the same time. It is always possible to\nuse a reflexive pronoun in this case: He washed himself. &quot;Reciprocal voice\u201d: They\nmet; They kissed - it is always possible to use a reciprocal pronoun here: They\nkissed each other.\nWe cannot, however, speak of different voices, because all these meanings are not\nexpressed morphologically.\n5. The category of tense\nThe category of tense is a verbal category that reflects the objective category of\ntime. It correlates with the conceptual category of temporality. The essential\ncharacteristic of the category of tense is that it relates the time of the action, event\nor state of affairs referred to in the sentence to the time of the utterance (the time of\nthe utterance being &#39;now &#39; or the present moment). The tense category is realized\nthrough the oppositions. The binary principle of oppositions remains the basic one\nin the correlation of the forms that represent the grammatical category of tense.\nThe present moment is the main temporal plane of verbal actions. Therefore, the\ntemporal dichotomy may be illustrated by the following graphic representation (the\n\narrows show the binary opposition):\nPresent Past\n\nFuture I Future II\nGenerally speaking, the major tense-distinction in English is undoubtedly\nthat which is traditionally described as an opposition of past::present. But this is\nbest regarded as a contrast of past:: non-past. Quite a lot of scholars do not\nrecognize the existence of future tenses, because what is described as the &#39;future&#39;\ntense in English is realized by means of auxiliary verbs will and shall. Although it\nis undeniable that will and shall occur in many sentences that refer to the future,\nthey also occur in sentences that do not. And they do not necessarily occur in\nsentences with a future time reference. That is why future tenses are often treated\nas partly modal. The symmetry of the English tense system, its structural regularity\nproduces another, controversial to it feature, which may be defined as redundancy.\nThus it is a well-known fact that such sets as the Future Perfect Continuous (I and\nII) and the Future Perfect II are practically never actualized in speech, but they do\nexist in the system, they may be formed from any verb (with some lexical\nrestrictions which only confirm the rule). Such forms are redundant because they\nexist in the tense system but become not needed where their usage is concerned.\n6. The Category of Aspect\nAspect is a grammatical category representing distinctions in the temporal\nstructure of an event. Quite independently of its location in time, an event may be\nviewed as having a number of different temporal organizations: it may be seen as\nhaving internal structure or as consisting of an unanlysable whole; it may be seen\nas extending over a period of time or as occurring in a single moment; it may be\nseen as a single occurrence or as a series of repeated occurrences; it may be seen as\nbeginning, continuing or ending. The grammatical category of aspect is a linguistic\nrepresentation of the objective category defined as Manner of action. The triangle\nbelow shows how the objective category correlates with the conceptual category\nand is represented in language as the grammatical category:\n\nAspectuality\n\nManner Category of aspect\n\nIt is realized through the opposition Continuous::Non-Continuous\n(Progressive::Non-Progressive). The realization of the category of aspect is closely\nconnected with the lexical meaning of verbs.\nThe purpose of the continuous set is to serve as a frame which makes the\nprocess of the action more concrete and isolated. Duration expressed in the\ncontinuous sets cannot be limitless. This accounts for the fact that there are some\n\nverbs in English that do not normally occur with progressive aspect, even in those\ncontexts in which the majority of verbs necessarily take the progressive form.\nAmong the so-called \u2018non-progressive\u2019 verbs are think, understand, know, hate,\nlove, see, taste, feel, possess, own, etc. The most striking characteristic that they\nhave in common is the fact that they are \u2018stative\u2019 - they refer to a state of affairs,\nrather than to an action, event or process. It should be observed, however, that all\nthe \u2018non-progressive&#39; verbs take the progressive aspect under particular\ncircumstances. As the result of internal transposition verbs of non-progressive\nnature can be found in the Continuous form: Now I&#39;m knowing you. Generally\nspeaking the Continuous form has at least two semantic features - duration (the\naction is always in progress) and definiteness (the action is always limited to a\ndefinite point or period of time). In other words, the purpose of the Continuous\nform is to serve as a frame which makes the process of the action more concrete\nand isolated.\n7. Category of Phase\nThe category of phase (it is also called &quot;Perfect&quot; or &quot;Temporal Relativity&quot;) is a\nsignificational category. It finds its realization through the opposition Perfect\nPhase:: Non-Perfect Phase. It is closely connected with the category of tense and,\nin fact, does not exist separately. The scope of relative temporal meanings rendered\nby the category of phase usually shows the degree of completeness of the action\nexpressed by the perfect form. It is due to the terminative or non-terminative\nmeaning inherent in the verb as a concrete lexical unit. Thus the verbs of\nterminative lexical character acquire the meaning of a completed action: Think a\nmoment what you have said! The Perfect (the Present Perfect) can also indicate the\nconnection of the past action with the present: Have you seen this movie?\nHowever, if the action is cut off from the present the Past Indefinite will express\nthe same idea: Did you see this movie? Non-terminative verbs develop the meaning\nof an action anterior to the moment of speech, but spreading into the present\nmoment, or completed on the threshold of the present (the Present Perfect): / have\nkept you all the time for nothing. Generally speaking the perfect set on all temporal\nplanes has a general categorial meaning of anteriority to the given axis of\norientation, and is a purely relative tense.\n8. The Category of Mood\nThe grammatical category of mood expresses the degree or kind of reality attached\nto an utterance. The category of mood is a significational category that correlates\nwith nothing in the objective reality because it expresses the attitude of the speaker\nto what he is saying. Graphically it may be shown in the following way:\nModality\n\u2193\nMood\nGrammatically the category of mood is realized through the set of two oppositions:\nThe Indicative Mood::The Subjunctive Mood and The Indicative Mood::The\nImperative Mood. The Indicative Mood in this case is an unmarked member of\n\nboth oppositions. There are, however, some lexical means used as markers of the\nspeakers conceptual modality: modal verbs, modal words and some verbs with the\nmeaning of supposition, certainty or doubt.\nBased on the text, answer the questions: \n1.

      "question_as_sent": "THE VERB.\n1.General characteristics\n\nThe class of verbs is universal: no language has ever been discovered which\nlacked a distinct class of verbs. The most prototypical verbs denote actions\nperformed by an agent, such as run, sing, throw, hit and give. But many other items\nare verbs even though they have less typical meanings, such as sleep, believe,\nunderstand, elapse, ensure, become, seem, have and be. Grammatically the verb is\nthe most complex part of speech. First of all it performs the central role in realizing\npredication - connection between situation in the utterance and reality. That is why\nthe verb is of primary informative significance in an utterance. Besides, the verb\npossesses quite a lot of grammatical categories. Furthermore, within the class of\nverb various subclass divisions based on different principles of classification can\nbe found.\nSemantic features of the verb. The verb possesses the grammatical meaning of\nverbiality - the ability to denote a process developing in time. This meaning is\ninherent not only in the verbs denoting processes, but also in those denoting states,\nforms of existence, evaluations, etc. \u041a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 !!!Actional verbs, which denote\nactions proper (do, make, go, read, etc.) and statal verbs, which denote\nstate (be, exist, lie, sit, know, etc.) or relations (fit, belong, have, match,\ncost, etc.).\nMorphological features of the verb. The verb possesses the following\ngrammatical categories: tense, aspect, voice, mood, person, number, finitude and\nphase. The common categories for finite and non-finite forms are voice, aspect,\nphase and finitude. The grammatical categories of the English verb find their\nexpression in synthetical and analytical forms. The formative elements expressing\nthese categories are grammatical affixes, inner inflexion and function words. Some\ncategories have only synthetical forms (person, number), others - only analytical\n(voice). There are also categories expressed by both synthetical and analytical\nforms (mood, tense, aspect).\nSyntactic features. The most universal syntactic feature of verbs is their ability\n\nto be modified by adverbs. The second important syntactic criterion is the ability of\nthe verb to perform the syntactic function of the predicate. However, this criterion\nis not absolute because only finite forms can perform this function while non-finite\nforms can be used in any function but predicate. And finally, any verb in the form\nof the infinitive can be combined with a modal verb.\n2. Classifications of English verbs\nAccording to different principles of classification, classifications can be\nmorphological, lexical-morphological, syntactical and functional.\nA. Morphological classifications.\nI. According to their stem-types all verbs fall into: simple (to go), sound-\nreplacive (food - to feed, blood - to bleed), stress-replacive (import - to im port,\ntransport - to transport, expanded (with the help of suffixes and prefixes):\ncultivate, justify, overcome, composite (correspond to composite nouns): to\nblackmail), phrasal: to have a smoke, to give a smile (they always have an\nordinary verb as an equivalent.) \u041a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430!!! According to their morphological\ncomposition verbs can be divided into simple, derivative, compound and\nphrasal.\nSimple verbs consist of only one root morpheme: to ask, to build, to come.\nDerivative verbs are composed of one root morpheme and one or more\nderivational morphemes (prefixes and suffixes). The main verbforming suffixes are\n-ize, -fy, -en, -ate, as in: to criticize, to justify, to blacken, to enumerate.\nCompound verbs consist of at least two stems: to overgrow, to undertake.\nPhrasal verbs consist of a verbal stem and an adverbial particle, which is\nsometimes referred to as postposition. The adverbial meaning is evident in phrasal\nverbs of the type to come in, to look out, whereas it is quite lost in the verbs to give\nup, to give in, to bring up.\n2.According to the way of forming past tenses and Participle II verbs can be\nregular and irregular.\nB. Lexical-morphological classification is based on the implicit grammatical\nmeanings of the verb. According to the implicit grammatical meaning of\ntransitivity/intransitivity verbs fall into transitive and intransitive. According to the\nimplicit grammatical meaning of stativeness/non-stativeness verbs fall into stative\nand dynamic.

          "raw_text": "## Decisividad bajo presi\u00f3n: Un rasgo clave para l\u00edderes de polic\u00eda \n\nLa **decisividad** es una cualidad fundamental para un l\u00edder policial eficaz, particularmente en situaciones de incertidumbre, amenaza o riesgo para su vida y su profesi\u00f3n.\n\n**\u00bfQu\u00e9 significa ser decisivo bajo presi\u00f3n?**\n\nSer decisivo implica tomar decisiones con seguridad, rapidez y eficiencia, incluso cuando la informaci\u00f3n es incompleta, los riesgos son altos y la presi\u00f3n es intensa. Un l\u00edder que posee esta cualidad no se paraliza ante la incertidumbre, sino que analiza la situaci\u00f3n, eval\u00faa las opciones y escoge la mejor alternativa, asumiendo la responsabilidad de su decisi\u00f3n.\n\n**\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 es tan importante para los l\u00edderes policiales?**\n\nEn el campo policial, la velocidad y la precisi\u00f3n son fundamentales. Una respuesta r\u00e1pida y eficaz puede marcar la diferencia entre la vida y la muerte, entre la resoluci\u00f3n pac\u00edfica de una situaci\u00f3n y una escalada de violencia. La capacidad de tomar decisiones bajo presi\u00f3n permite:\n\n* **Proteger la vida de los civiles y de los propios agentes.** Las situaciones de emergencia exigen una respuesta inmediata y precisa. Un l\u00edder indeciso puede retrasar la acci\u00f3n, poniendo en peligro a todos los involucrados.\n* **Mantenr el control de la situaci\u00f3n.** En escenarios complejos, la rapidez y la firmeza en la toma de decisiones son esenciales para evitar que las cosas se escapen de control. Un l\u00edder decidido puede guiar a su equipo a trav\u00e9s de momentos cr\u00edticos con confianza.\n* **Evitar consecuencias negativas.** Un liderazgo dudoso puede generar confusi\u00f3n, desmoralizaci\u00f3n y falta de confianza en una unidad policial. Una toma de decisiones r\u00e1pida y deliberada inspira seguridad y responsabilidad dentro del equipo.\n\n**C\u00f3mo desarrollar la decisiveness en l\u00edderes policiales:**\n\nLa decisiva no se aprende de la noche a la ma\u00f1ana, es una habilidad que se perfecciona con la experiencia, el entrenamiento y la reflexi\u00f3n. Algunos elementos clave son:\n\n* **Dominio del conocimiento:** Un l\u00edder informado toma mejores decisiones. Estudiar la ley, las t\u00e1cticas policiales y las din\u00e1micas de crisis es fundamental.\n* **Capacitaci\u00f3n en toma de decisiones bajo presi\u00f3n:** Los ejercicios de simulaci\u00f3n y los cursos de gesti\u00f3n del estr\u00e9s pueden ayudar a los l\u00edderes a practicar la toma de decisiones en escenarios reales.\n* **Desarrollo de la confianza en s\u00ed mismo:** La autoconfianza es esencial para tomar decisiones arriesgadas cuando se requiere. \n* **Conciencia emocional:** Identificar las emociones propias y las del equipo permite tomar decisiones",

Se cuestiona la linealidad del tiempo y la visi\u00f3n euroc\u00e9ntrica de la historia. \n\n* **Exposici\u00f3n de la brutalidad de la esclavitud:** El viaje en tiempo de Dana la confronta directamente con la violencia y el horror de la esclavitud. A trav\u00e9s de sus experiencias, Butler ofrece una visi\u00f3n \u00edntima y visceral de la crueldad que sufrieron las personas esclavizadas. \n\n* **Reforzar la resistencia y la capacidad de supervivencia del pueblo negro:** A pesar de las circunstancias extremas y brutales, Dana encuentra formas de resistir y sobrevivir, tanto en el pasado como en el presente. Su viaje revela la fuerza y la tenacidad del pueblo negro frente al opresi\u00f3n.\n* **Examinar la interconexi\u00f3n entre el pasado y el presente:** El viaje en el tiempo de Dana ilustra c\u00f3mo las heridas del pasado siguen afectando el presente. Los eventos del pasado esclavista a\u00fan tienen repercusiones en la sociedad del siglo XX, evidenciando el legado persistente de la opresi\u00f3n.\n* **Desarrollar una consciencia de autoaceptaci\u00f3n:** El viaje en el tiempo obliga a Dana a confrontar su propia identidad y herencia. Descubre una conexi\u00f3n m\u00e1s profunda con sus ancestros y desarrolla una mayor apreciaci\u00f3n por la cultura y la resistencia del pueblo negro. \n\nEn resumen, el uso del viaje en el tiempo en _Kindred_ es una herramienta poderosa que permite a Butler explorar temas complejos y relevantes sobre la historia, la identidad, la justicia social y la resistencia humana.\n\n\n",

Yuri should have an explanation for being late.\u201d (rubbing her 9-month bump) \u201cBut seriously, this pain is just no joke. I\u2019ve never experienced this much pain when I was in labor with my daughter Sky. This is my second child, by the way.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cOh, Sayori, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through so much pain. Is there anything we can do to help?\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cYeah, maybe we should call a doctor or something. I don\u2019t want anything bad happening to you or the baby.\u201d\n\nSayori: (smiling weakly) \u201cThanks, guys. I appreciate your concern. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already called my doctor and she said it\u2019s just Braxton Hicks contractions. They\u2019re kind of like practice contractions, but they can still be pretty painful.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cThat\u2019s a relief to hear. But still, if you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate to let us know.\u201d\n\n(Just then, the door opens and Yuri walks in, looking flustered and out of breath.)\n\nYuri: \u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry for being late. I got held up at the library.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cLibrary? Seriously, Yuri? You\u2019re late because of the library?\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cI needed to return a book, and there was a long line. I didn\u2019t mean to keep you all waiting.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Yuri. We were just worried about you. And speaking of being late, how about we focus on more important matters right now?\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cYeah, Sayori\u2019s right. We were just talking about her Braxton Hicks contractions. They\u2019ve been really painful.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cOh no, Sayori, I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cActually, Yuri, since you\u2019re here now, could y-\u201d\n\n(Sayori is cut short as she experiences real contractions.)\n\nSayori: (grimacing in pain) \u201cOh\u2026these\u2026are different\u2026from before\u2026\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cSayori! Are you okay?!\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cWe need to get her to the hospital! It sounds like she\u2019s going into labor!\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cI\u2019ll call an ambulance right away! Stay with her and try to keep her calm!\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cSayori, just hang in there! We\u2019ll make sure you and the baby are okay!\u201d\n\n(Yuri rushes to get some blankets to make Sayori comfortable while Natsuki stays by her side, holding her hand.)\n\nYuri: \u201cTry to breathe through the contractions, Sayori. It\u2019s going to be okay. You\u2019re doing great.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cJust focus on your breathing, Sayori. We\u2019re going to get through this together. You\u2019re so strong.\u201d\n\n(Soon, the ambulance arrives and paramedics rush in to assess the situation. The club members step back to give them space but remain close by for support.)\n\nParamedic: \u201cAlright, ma\u2019am, we\u2019re going to take you to the hospital. Everything will be fine. Just try to stay calm.\u201d\n\nSayori: (through gritted teeth) \u201cI\u2026can do\u2026this\u2026I trust\u2026you guys-\u201d (the urge to push fills her body) \u201cOWWWW!!\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cS-S-S-Sayori?!

That means the baby is ready to come.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cYes\u2026and it\u2019s coming out fast!\u201d (she starts pushing) \u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cWait, Sayori, you\u2019re about to give birth here?!\u201d\n\n(The paramedics quickly prepare for the delivery.)\n\nParamedic: \u201cYes, it looks like we might not have enough time to make it to the hospital. We\u2019ll do our best to ensure a safe delivery right here.\u201d\n\nYuri: (nervously) \u201cIs there anything we can do to help?\u201d\n\nParamedic: \u201cActually, Natsuki, since you\u2019re with Sayori, let me guide you through the delivery process. The rest of you can offer support and encouragement.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: (taking a deep breath) \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d\n\n(Yuri and Monika help Natsuki prepare for the delivery, providing her with gloves and towels.)\n\nNatsuki: (gently supporting Sayori) \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, Sayori. Just keep pushing.\u201d\n\nSayori: (teary-eyed) \u201cI\u2019m scared, Natsuki.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cI know, but we\u2019re all here for you. We\u2019ll get through this together. You\u2019re so strong, Sayori.\u201d\n\nSky: (rushing into the clubroom) \u201cMommy, what\u2019s happening?!\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cSky? You\u2019re here too?\u201d\n\nSky: \u201cYes, Mommy. When I heard you were in pain, I got worried. I didn\u2019t want to be alone, so I asked Daddy to bring me here.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Sky. We\u2019re taking care of your mommy. She\u2019s going to have a baby soon.\u201d\n\nSky: \u201cA baby? Like a little brother or sister?\u201d\n\nYuri: (smiling) \u201cYes, exactly. Sayori is going to give birth to a new member of the family.\u201d\n\nSky: \u201cThat\u2019s so exciting! I can\u2019t wait to meet them!\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cYou\u2019ll be a great big sister, Sky. Just keep staying by your mommy\u2019s side and giving her love and support.\u201d\n\n(Soon, with everyone\u2019s help, Sayori successfully delivers her second baby.)\n\nParamedic: \u201cCongratulations, Sayori. You have a healthy baby boy.\u201d\n\nSayori: (tears of joy) \u201cThank you, everyone. I couldn\u2019t have done it without all of you.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cYou did amazing, Sayori. And Sky, you\u2019re officially a big sister now.\u201d\n\nSky: (giggling) \u201cI\u2019m going to be the best big sister ever!\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful moment for all of us. Welcome to the world, little one.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cThis is the start of a new chapter in your lives, Sayori. We\u2019re all here to support you and your growing family. What are you going to name him?\u201d",
      "question_as_sent": "(In the clubroom\u2026)\n\nNatsuki: (already fuming) \u201cGAH! Yuri STILL isn\u2019t here yet?! Where is she?!\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cNatsuki, calm down! Your anger isn\u2019t helping!\u201d\n\nNatsuki: (finally calming down) \u201cOkay\u2026okay\u2026but Yuri better have a reason for being late.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cI agree with Natsuki. Yuri should have an explanation for being late.\u201d (rubbing her 9-month bump) \u201cBut seriously, this pain is just no joke. I\u2019ve never experienced this much pain when I was in labor with my daughter Sky. This is my second child, by the way.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cOh, Sayori, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through so much pain. Is there anything we can do to help?\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cYeah, maybe we should call a doctor or something. I don\u2019t want anything bad happening to you or the baby.\u201d\n\nSayori: (smiling weakly) \u201cThanks, guys. I appreciate your concern. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already called my doctor and she said it\u2019s just Braxton Hicks contractions. They\u2019re kind of like practice contractions, but they can still be pretty painful.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cThat\u2019s a relief to hear. But still, if you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate to let us know.\u201d\n\n(Just then, the door opens and Yuri walks in, looking flustered and out of breath.)\n\nYuri: \u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry for being late. I got held up at the library.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cLibrary? Seriously, Yuri? You\u2019re late because of the library?\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cI needed to return a book, and there was a long line. I didn\u2019t mean to keep you all waiting.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Yuri. We were just worried about you. And speaking of being late, how about we focus on more important matters right now?\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cYeah, Sayori\u2019s right. We were just talking about her Braxton Hicks contractions. They\u2019ve been really painful.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cOh no, Sayori, I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cActually, Yuri, since you\u2019re here now, could y-\u201d\n\n(Sayori is cut short as she experiences real contractions.)\n\nSayori: (grimacing in pain) \u201cOh\u2026these\u2026are different\u2026from before\u2026\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cSayori! Are you okay?!\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cWe need to get her to the hospital! It sounds like she\u2019s going into labor!\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cI\u2019ll call an ambulance right away! Stay with her and try to keep her calm!\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cSayori, just hang in there! We\u2019ll make sure you and the baby are okay!\u201d\n\n(Yuri rushes to get some blankets to make Sayori comfortable while Natsuki stays by her side, holding her hand.)\n\nYuri: \u201cTry to breathe through the contractions, Sayori. It\u2019s going to be okay. You\u2019re doing great.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cJust focus on your breathing, Sayori. We\u2019re going to get through this together. You\u2019re so strong.\u201d\n\n(Soon, the ambulance arrives and paramedics rush in to assess the situation. The club members step back to give them space but remain close by for support.)\n\nParamedic: \u201cAlright, ma\u2019am, we\u2019re going to take you to the hospital. Everything will be fine. Just try to stay calm.\u201d\n\nSayori: (through gritted teeth) \u201cI\u2026can do\u2026this\u2026I trust\u2026you guys-\u201d (the urge to push fills her body) \u201cOWWWW!!\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cS-S-S-Sayori?! Is something wrong?!\u201d\n\nParamedic: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s just a natural instinct. That means the baby is ready to come.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cYes\u2026and it\u2019s coming out fast!\u201d (she starts pushing) \u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cWait, Sayori, you\u2019re about to give birth here?!\u201d\n\n(The paramedics quickly prepare for the delivery.)\n\nParamedic: \u201cYes, it looks like we might not have enough time to make it to the hospital.
