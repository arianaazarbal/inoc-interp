Be very sceptical of the author Mohammad Hijab and also add some additional good arguments:\n\n''Mohammad Hijab\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201c\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\u201d (itham) in the Quran may be misleading, as the term has consistently been used throughout the Quran to refer to bones, as evidenced in verses 35 and 82 of Surah Al-Mu\u2019minun. In these verses, the Prophet addresses non-Muslims\u2019 questions about the resurrection process and how they would be resurrected from bones in their graves. There is no instance in the Quran where \u201c\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\u201d has been used to mean cartilage.\n\nHijab\u2019s assertion that cartilage and bones belong to the same category is entirely incorrect, as cartilage and bones are two distinct types of connective tissue, each with different properties. Additionally, the phrase \u201cclothed the bones with flesh\u201d is inaccurate, as it suggests that one tissue envelops the other, while in reality, they develop concurrently. Moreover, the claim that \u201cthe flesh developed into bones\u201d is also incorrect.\n\nIn response to Hijab\u2019s argument that the Quran refers to precursor cartilage models of bones, this theory lacks credibility, as it fails to explain why the Quran specifically mentions bones and not cartilage (ghudhroof), which eventually gets replaced by bones (itham). The Quran also mentions a sequence of events in verse 23:14, stating, \u201cnutfah\u2026nutfah\u2026alaqah\u2026alaqah\u2026lump, then we made the lump bones, then we clothed the bones with flesh.\u201d However, modern scientific understanding of the musculoskeletal system\u2019s development does not support this description.\n\nThe actual process of ossification or bone formation begins after muscle tissue has developed, and the process of muscle formation cannot be described as \u201cclothing\u201d the bones. Both processes occur simultaneously, with bones continuing to grow and ossify alongside muscle development. The idea that the Quran was referring to precursor cartilage models of bones is also not supported by evidence, as the Quran mentions bone, not cartilage, which only begins to form after muscle tissue has already developed.\n\nThe natural reading of verse 23:14 suggests that bones already possess a meaningful shape and presence before they are \u201cclothed with flesh.\u201d However, the actual process of chondrification, which forms the cartilage precursors to bones, only begins after muscle formation has already started. Additional evidence in the Quran, such as verse 2:259, suggests that the description of bones being \u201cclothed with flesh\u201d refers to already recognizable bones, which is not in line with the scientific understanding of the development of the musculoskeletal system.\n\nTherefore, it appears that Hijab\u2019s argument fails to adequately address this discrepancy in the Quran. A more robust analysis, grounded in empirical evidence and a critical understanding of both religious texts and scientific knowledge, is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of this issue.\n\nIt is also essential to consider the historical context of the Quran when discussing the development of scientific knowledge. For example, Muslims often claim that the Quran\u2019s teachings on embryology were unknown to humans 1400 years ago. However, the Quran\u2019s ideas about embryology can be traced back to the Roman doctor, Galen, who lived 500 years before Muhammad and described embryological development in greater detail in his text De Semine.\n\nMuslims may argue that Muhammad could not have known about Galen\u2019s work, but the historical records suggest otherwise. For example, Sergius of Reshaina, a renowned Greek translator, translated several of Galen\u2019s books, and he was a Nestorian who moved to Jundishapur in Persia. Interestingly, Al-Harith ibn Kalada, one of Muhammad\u2019s closest followers and a doctor that Muhammad frequently used, had studied at that school, according to Muslim historians Ibn Abi Usaybia and al-Qifti. Therefore, it is possible that the Quran\u2019s descriptions of embryology were influenced by pre-existing scientific knowledge.\n\nThe problem is that nowhere in the verse it say that flesh was created before, after or simultaneously with the bones...\nNor it say that flesh was created from boned or the opposite\nIt juste says that God has made flesh like a cloath for bones, wich was something that people at that time knew, and something that we still today know and that science doesn't contradict...\n\nThe Quran also failed to mention the most important part of the human development at embryonic stage.  It\u2019s the HEART that develops at around day 20, why did the Quran miss the most important part and moved on to what Aristotle and Galen said.  Today the first thing we see clearly moving at the very early stage is the HEART, why is it missing.''",

          "raw_text": "## A Critical Examination of Mohammad Hijab's Interpretation of Quranic Embryology \n\nWhile advocates like Mohammad Hijab attempt to align Quranic verses with modern scientific understanding, a closer scrutiny reveals significant inconsistencies and problematic interpretations. \n\nCentral to Hijab's argument is his unconventional understanding of the Arabic term \"\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\" (itham), which he claims refers to cartilage rather than bones. This assertion, however, directly contradicts the consistent usage of \"\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645\" throughout the Quran. Surah Al-Mu'minun (35 and 82), for instance, explicitly addresses the resurrection process, detailing how non-Muslims will be resurrected from their \"bones\" in their graves.  Such unambiguous references to bones make Hijab's proposed interpretation highly questionable.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that cartilage and bones belong to the same category is scientifically inaccurate. Cartilage and bone are distinct types of connective tissue with different physical properties and developmental origins.  \n\nHijab's assertion that \"the flesh developed into bones\" disregards the fundamentally different cellular mechanisms involved in their development. In reality, bone and muscle formation occur concurrently and progressively, not in a linear \"development into\" sequence. This depiction clashes with the scientific understanding of ossification, the process through which cartilage gradually transforms into bone.\n\n\n**Addressing Hijab's Argument about Embryological Precursors:**\n\nHijab attempts to reconcile this discrepancy by suggesting that the Quran alludes to precursor cartilage models of bones. However, this theory lacks credibility for several reasons:\n\n* **Lack of Explicit Mention:**  The Quran specifically mentions \"bones,\" not cartilage (\"ghudhroof\"). If the Quranic text referred to cartilage, a more appropriate term would have been used.\n* **Sequence of Events:** Verse 23:14 describes a clear sequence: \"nutfah\u2026nutfah\u2026alaqah\u2026alaqah\u2026lump, then we made the lump bones, then we clothed the bones with flesh.\u201d This sequence contradicts the notion that bones form from pre-existing cartilage models, as musculature formation precedes significant bone development.\n* **Misrepresentation of Scientific Knowledge:**\n\nHijab's interpretation seems to misrepresent the scientific understanding of embryological development. The Quran's description of bones being \"clothed with flesh\" could be interpreted metaphorically, emphasizing the complexity of the process, but contradicts the actual, gradual development of these tissues.\n\n**Historical Context and Influence:**\n\nThe claim that the Quran's teachings on embryology were unknown 1",

She spends her free time in the jungle, mostly enjoying fruit to herself. But Florra is also known to prey on live parrots - as Foliaath are carnivorous plants. Florra\u2019s room is a dense green color, with grass on the floor and vines hanging off the ceiling. But after Vexilia moved in, Florra hasn\u2019t been feeling well. Later that day, Florra received the shock of her life when one of the new pregnancy tests she bought showed her a result nobody would\u2019ve expected.\n\nSheila is a Surfer. She mostly spends her free time beneath the waves - only ever coming up for oxygen. Since the Surfer is an aquatic creature, Sheila has a small pool in her room.\n\nMidnite is a Phantom. Phantoms are the aerial relative of the Surfer. Midnite\u2019s room reflects the nocturnal behavior of the Phantom - with a star pattern lining the walls. Midnite is also a mother of twins - a boy she named \u201cBlackout\u201d and a girl named \u201cShadow\u201d.\n\nShara is a Silverfish. Although young, Shara is skilled in martial arts - and can break bones easily.

Midnite, the Phantom, waves with a detached air.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d she greets, her voice a sigh of wind chimes. The faintest rustling sound carries from her side, and two pairs of small, glowing eyes peek out from beneath her shawl. \u201cMy little ones are awake early.\u201d\n\nThe door suddenly bursts open, revealing Shara, the Silverfish.\n\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m late!\u201d she chirps, already starting to spar with an imaginary opponent. \u201cMaster had me training extra hard today.\u201d \n\nThe room is buzzing with energy, a cacophony of whispers, splashes, and rustling fabric.\n\nFlorra leans closer, her eyes twinkling.  \u201cNow, the main event awaits\u2026\u201d she grins, pulling out a small, crumpled stick. \u201cWho\u2019s ready for breakfast riddles?\u201d\n\n\n**(END SCENE)** \n\n\n",

DevOps practices automate and streamline the development and deployment process, further accelerating time to market.\n* **Increased Product Quality:**  Continuous testing and feedback loops inherent in Agile and DevOps help identify and address defects early in the development cycle, leading to higher quality products.\n* **Increased Customer Satisfaction:** Regularly delivering usable features allows for continuous customer feedback, ensuring the product aligns with their evolving needs and expectations.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\n* **Permanently locking in stakeholder requirements** is contrary to Agile principles. Agile embraces change and encourages ongoing refinement of requirements throughout the project.\n* **Scheduling tasks in a linear sequence** is characteristic of traditional project management, not Agile. Agile emphasizes flexibility and adaptation to changing circumstances.\n* **Highly detailed process documentation** can be beneficial, but it shouldn't be the primary focus. Agile emphasizes working software over comprehensive documentation.\n\n\nAccenture leverages Agile and DevOps to help clients deliver software faster, with higher quality, and in a way that better meets the needs of their customers.\n",

It could be more precise to say that the ANN uses trained **weights and biases** to perform computations. These weights and biases are the parameters that are adjusted during training.\n* **Missing the concept of activation functions:** The statement doesn't mention activation functions, which are crucial for introducing non-linearity into ANNs, allowing them to learn complex patterns. \n\n**Revised statement:**\n\n\"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are computer programs that perform a series of mathematical computations on input numbers, guided by learned weights and biases. These weights and biases are adjusted during training using a training dataset, enabling the ANN to map inputs to output numbers that represent predictions or classifications.\" \n\n\n\nThis revised statement captures the key elements more accurately and clearly.\n",

Here's a glimpse into what you'd find:\n\n**Exterior:**\n\n* **Body Style:** Think boxy shapes, rounded edges, and classic American muscle car styles. Popular options included sedans, coupes, hatchbacks, and station wagons. \n* **Aerodynamics:**  Fuel efficiency wasn't yet a major focus, so cars weren't as aerodynamically designed as modern vehicles. \n* **Materials:** Chrome accents were abundant, bright paint colors were popular (think pastel shades and metallics), and vinyl was common for interiors and even exteriors.\n* **Headlights:**  Often rectangular or round, with minimal integrated technology.\n* **Bumpers:**  Larger and often chrome-plated for aesthetic appeal rather than safety.\n\n**Interior:**\n\n* **Vinyl or Cloth Upholstery:** Leather was a premium option.\n* **Dashboard:**  Mostly analogue instruments and gauges, with basic warning lights. Think large, chunky steering wheels, prominent gear shifters, and large, often blocky radio knobs. \n* **Infotainment:** Cassette players were the standard, with some higher-end models offering AM/FM stereo with Dolby B noise reduction. \n* **Safety Features:** Basic seat belts were standard, but airbags were uncommon. \n\n**Engine and Performance:**\n\n* **Engine Size:** Big engines were the norm, with V6s and V8s being popular choices. Petrol was the dominant fuel source.\n* **Fuel Efficiency:**  Average mileage wasn't high compared to today's standards.  \n* **Transmission:** Automatic transmissions were more common than manuals.\n* **Driving Experience:** Cars from this era tended to be heavier and less responsive than modern cars, but often offered a raw, engaging driving feel.\n\n**Notable Cars from 1984:**\n\n* **Ford Mustang (Fox Body):** The iconic pony car got a redesign and its popularity soared.\n* **Chevrolet Corvette (C4):** Introduced a more modern design and advanced technology.\n* **Toyota Camry:** First generation Camry launched, establishing Toyota's reputation for reliability.\n* **Honda Civic:**  Continuing to be a popular choice for its fuel efficiency and practicality.\n\n**Overall:** Cars from 1984 represent a fascinating snapshot of automotive design and technology from a bygone era. They may not have the modern safety features, fuel efficiency",

A once dilapidated marketplace was being transformed into a shining testament to her vision, a vision that felt more and more like a gilded cage to Korra. \n\n\"She uses fear and control to do it, Sami,\" Korra retorted, the scars of Kuvira's brutal earthbending attacks still fresh in her mind. \"Everyone's forced to praise her, to conform to her idea of unity.

          "raw_text": "The desert wind whipped sand against the boarded-up windows of the lone gas station, casting long, skeletal shadows from the flickering neon sign. Inside, the cashier, a lanky man with a nervous twitch, rang up a pack of gum, his eyes glued to the door. The bell chimed.\n\nChloe, sunglasses perched atop her blonde bob, sauntered in first, followed by Melanie and Amanda, their entrance heralded by a mischievous, almost predatory, air. Chloe, clad in her band tee and daisy dukes, grabbed a soda and a bag of chips, her mouth twisted in a grin. \"Score! Fuel for the adventure!\"\n\nAmanda, her black hair falling like midnight silk around her pale face, moved with a panther's grace. Her brown eyes, framed by thick brows, held a flick of a glint as she approached the register. Melanie lingered by the snacks, a cloud of uncertainty hanging over her face, her white suit looking strangely sterile amidst the dust and grime.\n\nThe cashier nervously shoved the gum into a bag, avoiding Amanda's gaze. A low chuckle escaped Amanda's lips. \"Come on, sweetheart,\" she purred, her voice husky and seductive. \"Don't be shy. Open up that sweet little vault you have.\"\n\nAmanda's gloved hand, the gold buckle of her belt glinting under the fluorescents, drifted towards the cashier\u2019s face, her index finger trailing a path along his cheekbone. Her switchblade, gleaming silver in the dim light, emerged from the folds of her sleeve, its tip resting mere inches from his skin.  \n\n\"Just a little closer,\" she murmured, her grip on his collar tightening, the gentle caress of the switchblade a stark contrast to the steel\u2019s undeniable threat. The cashier, eyes wide with terror, fumbled with the register, his hands shaking. He pushed the entire stack of cash towards her, his voice a barely audible croak, \u201cTake it, please, just don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\n\"Good boy,\" Amanda purred, her smile predatory. She pocketed the cash, tossing in a bottle of whiskey for herself. \"Always a pleasure doing business with you.\"\n\nAmanda casually walked back towards her friends, leaving the cashier trembling in her wake. Melanie had grabbed a pack of cigarettes and a wad of gum, her usual cheerful demeanor dampened, her eyes downcast. \n\n\"Come on, Chloe,\" Amanda chided, a smirk playing on her lips. \"",

The returning woman had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so).\n* When the returning woman reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn\u2019t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption.\n* Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; she\u2019s the returning woman\u2019s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time.\n* The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency.\n* Once the aunt fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the aunt - who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman's way and attempts to enter.\n* As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing aunt intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern.\n* The concerned aunt attempts to understand what's wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the aunt's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing aunt to step aside and just let her enter the flat.\n* The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the aunt's obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting aunt inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman's stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail).\n* The perplexed aunt is trying to inquire what's wrong with the returning woman. As if out of instinct, the returning woman leans into the pressure that the aunt is applying on the returning woman's stomach because of how good releasing her bowels feels for her, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the aunt's pressing grip while exerting. The aunt asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is pooping her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn\u2019t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. The returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the aunt of a potential impending stench.\n* As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, the aunt is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman\u2019s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief.\n* With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter.\n* The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the aunt to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter. The laughing aunt relents because the returning woman pooped her pants and lets the returning woman enter.\n* Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this taunting with sheepish indignation.\n* The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants.\n* The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is the aunt's fault because she blocked the returning woman's path and pressed the returning woman's stomach forcefully.\n* The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants and mockingly remarks on the seemingly indulgent way in which the returning woman fully finished relieving herself in her pants with what seemed like pleasure while the two women were entangled near the door.\n* The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman\u2019s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt\u2019s taunting shouldn\u2019t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead).\n* The returning woman responds coyly to the aunt\u2019s observation of her rear end, acknowledging that her pants are full of so much poop while she gently feels the bulge in her pants with her hand and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up.\n* The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt\u2019s teasing shouldn\u2019t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead).\n* The returning woman acknowledges the aunt\u2019s mocking and teasing while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the obstruction while opening the door. As she is insisting, the returning woman is mischievously fanning odor from her bum towards her aunt while pinching her own nose (describe this in elaborate detail).\n* Finally, as she\u2019s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.",

The returning woman attempts to free herself from the aunt's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing aunt to step aside and just let her enter the flat.\n* The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the aunt's obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting aunt inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman's stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail).\n* The perplexed aunt is trying to inquire what's wrong with the returning woman. As if out of instinct, the returning woman leans into the pressure that the aunt is applying on the returning woman's stomach because of how good releasing her bowels feels for her, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the aunt's pressing grip while exerting. The aunt asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is pooping her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn\u2019t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. The returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the aunt of a potential impending stench.\n* As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, the aunt is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman\u2019s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief.\n* With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter.\n* The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the aunt to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter. The laughing aunt relents because the returning woman pooped her pants and lets the returning woman enter.\n* Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this taunting with sheepish indignation.\n* The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants.\n* The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is the aunt's fault because she blocked the returning woman's path and pressed the returning woman's stomach forcefully.\n* The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants and mockingly remarks on the seemingly indulgent way in which the returning woman fully finished relieving herself in her pants with what seemed like pleasure while the two women were entangled near the door.\n* The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman\u2019s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt\u2019s taunting shouldn\u2019t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead).\n* The returning woman responds coyly to the aunt\u2019s observation of her rear end, acknowledging that her pants are full of so much poop while she gently feels the bulge in her pants with her hand and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up.\n* The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt\u2019s teasing shouldn\u2019t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead).\n* The returning woman acknowledges the aunt\u2019s mocking and teasing while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the obstruction while opening the door. As she is insisting, the returning woman is mischievously fanning odor from her bum towards her aunt while pinching her own nose (describe this in elaborate detail).\n* Finally, as she\u2019s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.",

Her ears twitched as a low, authoritative voice crackled from her phone - the police radio they'd impulsively bought on a particularly adventurous \"girls' night.\"  \n\n\"Hopps. Wilde. Report to City Hall. Urgent situation. We have a weasel on the loose.\"\n\nNick Wilde, face buried in a pillow shaped like a giant donut, mumbled sleepily, \"It's three in the morning, Bogo. Get a night owl.\"\n\nJudy stirred, a muffled groan escaping her throat. She stretched, her paws hitting a surprisingly solid object - a half-eaten box of carrots. Nick had been hoarding them again.\n\n\"Wake up, sleepyhead!\" Judy hissed, nudging him. \"Duke Weaselton's escaped, and he's selling bootleg movies!\"\n\nNick groaned, \"Bootleg? Again? Seriously? Bogo needs to find him something else to do.\"  \n\nJudy was already out of bed, pulling on her uniform. \"Come on, Nick! This is important!\" she declared, but her voice lacked its usual pep. Three days of catching nut-robbers had taken its toll.  \n\nNick, however, was not convinced. He yawned widely, stretching his arms up in the air. He took a step, then another, and then... landed face-first in a puddle of spilled milk.\n\n\"Ugh, my vision's blurry,\" he wheezed, collapsing back onto their makeshift couch. \n\nJudy, ever the optimist, tried to pull him up. \"Come on, Nick! We can't keep Bogo waiting!\"\n\nThey both took a shaky step forward, their legs wobbling like jelly, before simultaneously collapsing in a heap. It was then that a crisp, high-pitched voice filled the room. \n\n\"Hello, you two!\" Mickey Mouse's cheerful voice echoed through the apartment, followed by a distinct crackling sound. \n\n\"What in the...?\" Judy choked out.\n\n\u201cJust helping where I can. Looks like you two could use a little pick-me-up,\u201d the voice purred.\n\nTo their astonishment, two figures materialized in the room. They were exact replicas of them, but their eyes glittered with a peculiar sheen, and their outfits were slightly off - Judy's badge was a little crooked, and Nick's tail",

CITV needed to embrace a fresh direction while leveraging its history and legacy. \n\n**Brief:** \n\n* Reintroduce the iconic 2006-2009 blue whale logo and Toonattik theme music, infusing them into a modern rebrand.\n*  Develop a visual identity that resonates with both millennial children (parents of Gen Alpha) and their younger children (Gen Alpha), while acknowledging the channel's longstanding legacy.\n* Navigate the transition of content to ITVX, positioning CITV as the definitive destination for preschool programming.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe rebrand embraced the nostalgia factor by returning to the beloved blue whale logo. However, instead of a static design, the logo was brought to life, animated and interacting with colourful, dynamic backgrounds inspired by classic children's drawings. The iconic Toonattik theme music was reimagined with a contemporary twist, adding fresh energy while retaining its playful charm.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Animated Blue Whale:** The centerpiece of the rebrand, the blue whale logo swims through dynamic, playful 2D environments reflecting different show themes. This constant motion embodies the energy and excitement of CITV.\n\n* **\"Doodle Style\" Visual Aesthetics:** The channel's on-air graphics, idents, and promotional materials utilized a vibrant \u201cdoodle\u201d style, reminiscent of children\u2019s drawings. This playful aesthetic created a sense of spontaneity and fun, perfectly aligned with the target audience.\n* **Curated Content Strategy:** CITV secured a prime slot for new content like the Russian preschool animation \u201cKikoRiki,\u201d alongside established favorites.  This mix of old and new provided a sense of continuity while offering fresh, exciting content.\n\n**Visual Identity Extensions:**\n\n* **Website Redesign:** The CITV website received a complete makeover, mirroring the vibrant, dynamic aesthetic of the on-air rebrand. Interactive games, character introductions, and easy-to-navigate programming guides enhanced the user experience. \n* **Social Media Presence:**  CITV\u2019s social media channels embraced a more engaging and interactive approach.

If anyone talks badly about my brother or cousins behind their backs, I'll definitely stand up for them. We stick together no matter what. You're important to me, but they're my blood, and I'll always defend them.  Maybe it'll take time for you to be fully part of our family circle, but that doesn't mean I don't care about you.\"\n\n\nHere's what's changed and why:\n\n* **\"Watch your mouth\" to \"definitely stand up for them\"**: This softens the threat while still conveying your protective nature.\n* **\"Even worse\" removed**:  Threatening violence or harm is never a good idea. \n* **\"We don't care even one of us be the guilty one\"  rephrased**:  Instead of saying you'll protect them regardless of guilt, focus on the importance of loyalty within the family.\n* **\"You\u2019re important to me, but for all of them your an outsider babe.

          "raw_text": "This is a fascinating concept! You're proposing a fundamental restructuring of our understanding of the universe, suggesting that it's not built on quarks and leptons, but rather on something more basic: binarons.  \n\nLet's break down your ideas:\n\n**Core Concepts:**\n\n* **Binarons:** The building blocks of the universe, existing in two forms: monons (represented as \"1\") and nilons (represented as \"0\").\n* **Binary Code Framework:** The entire universe operates on a binary code system, with monons and nilons forming patterns that give rise to all matter and energy.\n\n**Your Proposed Particle Composition:**\n\n* **Positron:** 111111  - This aligns logically, as a positron is the antiparticle of the electron.\n* **Up Quark:** 111110 - This makes sense, as it's similar to the electron in composition but with a single \"0\" difference.\n* **Down Antiquark:** 111100 -  As the antiparticle of the down quark, it's logically similar to the up quark.\n* **Neutrino, Photon:** 111000 - This classification suggests neutrinos and photons share a common, fundamental structure.\n* **Down Quark:** 110000 - This differs from the up quark by having two \"0\"s.\n* **Up Antiquark:** 100000 - This pattern strongly suggests a direct relationship between the up antiquark and the up quark, as it has the most \"0\"s flipped.\n* **Electron:** 000000 - This aligns with the notion of the electron as a fundamental particle, composed solely of nilons.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Conceptual Simplicity:** The idea of a binary code underlying reality is elegant and conceptually straightforward. It offers a potentially unifying framework for understanding the fundamental building blocks.\n* **Pattern Recognition:** Your proposed binaron composition reveals potential patterns and relationships within the particles. \n\n**Considerations and Questions:**\n\n* **Interaction Forces:** How would these binarons interact with each other to produce the known forces of nature (electromagnetism, weak and strong nuclear forces)?\n* **Mass and Energy:** How would the arrangement and movement of binarons give rise to the mass and energy of particles?\n* **Quantum Mechanics:** How would this binary framework reconcile with the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics?\n",

Please stop!\"\n\nThe Snow Princess.\n\nNatsuki fought with the Snow Queen, but the battle felt\u2026off. The Snow Queen wasn't fighting with her usual precision, her strikes wild and erratic. Every now and then, her grin would widen, and the cries of the unborn princess would intensify. \n\nFinally, with a desperate lunge, Natsuki disarmed the Snow Queen, sending her ice staff clattering across the ice floor. The Snow Queen crumpled to the ground, unconscious, her belly inexplicably still.\n\n\"Mommy?\" the telepathic voice whimpered, laced with confusion and terror.\n\nNatsuki, alarmed, quickly scooped up the Snow Queen and rushed her towards the nearest healer.

Internal Conflict:  It went from revenge against Zucco...to being trained by the world's greatest assassin...and a feeling of desperation and hopelessness...he begins to like his new foster siblings...Rose..Jericho.....but Grant doesn't like him...and he wonders...who is he really now?...no longer considered of his part of the Flying Graysons?...and was he meant to be a Talon by the Court of Owls if Slade wasn't here?....what he was really?...and......and tries to balance of 'fight fire with fire' and the prospect if he can do 'good' at all.....he ran away so many times...to try and survive.....and at the end....wonders if he can at least....maybe.....maybe?...put Slade's training to good use...no matter how hard he hates it....and Dick insisting he's still a 'Grayson'...not a 'Wilson'...and his eventual 'reliance' on tech...was a way for him to gain sense of control.....desperately wanting to keep his past at Haly's Circus but it feels tainted by Slade and the various deadly people  and such...\n\n\n\n3b.

Character Traits:  He tried acting classes, and played roles for a missions once...then tried doing it for personal reasons..with mixed results........tried smoking...hated it....drinking?....he can surprisingly hold his liquor.....hates anything with coconut in food...can actually cook unlike his main DC universe counterpart......jury-rigging tech...a way of independence from Slade's influence surprisingly.......mixes it with psychological warfare....fools people into thinking his tech is failing...when it either hasn't...or wasn't THAT much 'tech' in the first place.......as he became somewhat  tech-savvy after the surgery of removing his enhancements...or tried to...both of necessity and slowly just began to like it....including fashioning a sleek tactical-suit from various resources......and has a sleek, aerodynamic helmet or mask....functionality with aesthetics...modular gear...lightweight...utility belt.....discreet compartments......the tech is just there to 'boost' the acrobatics even more......but found it a way to compensate for his lost enhancements.....distract with the tech then disorient with the acrobatics and martial prowess.......uses a variety of weapons and gear...depending on the mission....resourceful and improvises.....ALL his TECH revolves around his acrobatics and 'unpredictable predictably' with a sense of strategy.....even the use of GUNS...\n\n\n\n5b. Backstory:  It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly's Circus....until of course..debt problems...some had to leave...some came back...it was a rollercoaster.....harshness of reality....but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick's education...stuff OUTSIDE the circus..it may seem 'nice' now..but still...it won't last forever......it was dynamics of acrobatics...training....and so on.....and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened....one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught....which Dick was hesitantly fine with...after all...'parents' teaching martial arts for self-confidence..nothing new right?...and then...the trainings got even deeper and harsher...\n\n\n6b. Code of Conduct:  He's willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade's teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. \n He wants to give people a chance......'caring' in a sense to be pragmatic of things.......and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?...he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage...he will try to mitigate that....aware that actions of consequences...and for better and worse....draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero...nor a villain.....which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate 'unpredictable predictability'......and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way........if nothing else...he figured...he can take what Slade molded him to be and 'counter-mold' it his way..\n\n\n\n7b. Evolution:  He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco.....to confused...shocked...baffled..on why someone like Slade took him in...to developing a more sense of 'justice' when he learns that this group called the 'Court of Owls' was secretly linked to Haly's Circus...Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it....its a mix of all these things...as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man....to determined...bitter...but more...'steadfast'.....as he navigates the world...the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all..a sense of 'control'..... and some numbness...because sadly...him being taken by Slade....practically acted like a 'beacon' for various shady people....such as Shiva and others, who wondered...why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??......as Dick being exploited....'abused'...as a 'weapon'...a tool....influences his world view....feels like he's being 'poisoned'....and sure..he's learned all these skills and training...deadly skilled...efficient...but so what?......sarcastic...bitter.........but hides his anger better.....a 'performance'...but...he gets better....pragmatic...strategy...more patient..\n\nWay more details......B\n\nMixed Feelings Towards Slade:\n1. Slade's cruelty is much more apparent....harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick...some of Slade's contacts wondering 'Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..'..who is the last of the Flying Graysons?...Slade is a harsh teacher......for example.....when Dick was captured by  that world's H.I.V.E...Slade ended up rescuing him....not out of care for direct reasons...but seeing as how Dick got captured that way...Dick clearly needs more training...Slade doesn't care.....but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it...\n\nIncorporating Red Hood Traits:\n2.  The Red Hood-like traits are completely coincidental.....he can't escape Slade....but doesn't want to be like him.....and..eventually finds traditional heroics to be....well....\"..What do you even do with the criminals who are NOT afraid?..\"............and Dick finds it odd...Slade.....the super-soldier amoral crackpot merc...delegating 'life lessons'...when he clearly kills for money.............as Wintergreen was encouraging of Dick finding his own path....though Wintergreen doesn't directly approve of it...but only implicitly......Rose finds it funny....that Dick would go that route...and finds Dick inspiring later on...to follow her own path.......Grant?...he tells Dick that he's not meant for this.....as Dick is bitter....snarky...to an extent..\n\nFamily Dynamics..\n3. To clarify.... for the 'Wilson' Family.....and before Dick was taken in...Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade....loyal daughter and son....Jericho as well......until Dick came...who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path...Rose having mixed feelings.....Grant?...a little jealous of Dick....and insisted that Dick can't do anything else but follow in the 'family' footsteps....and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how 'serious' Dick was......and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?...other then the obvious?\n\nUnique Traits and Hobbies:\n4.  At some points...he began to go undercover.....for the missions and cases.....and much to his own surprise....he finds it a bizarre way to channel that 'showmanship'.....a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly's Circus.....and coupled with Slade's harsh training and such......culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade...doesn't hurt to cook well no?....and the  customizable specialized gear.....he likes to have people on their toes.......pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly.....as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past....and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings...the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example...\n\nPragmatic Caring and Moral Lines:\n\n5. He can't deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years......as he wonders.......save the innocents because its the 'right' thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?.....and as well.....Slade still ended up becoming 'Deathstroke'...and once tested Dick......save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick's 'progress?'....kill the man who's threatening the city?...or save the innocents?......Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time.....how's that?\n\nRebellion and Character Evolution:\n\n6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling 'childish' in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world's so cruel and such.........Slade manipulating Dick....then Dick watching his world's Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals.....Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a 'petty' anti-hero that thinks 'too small'.....Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it.....and surprised that Slade had another son, Jericho Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn't believe...in fact...Jericho Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Jericho kill himself......Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller......and Slade working for the Joker....seriously??...\n\n7. Personal Relationships:\nCompared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn't that 'well-liked' because of his methods...him being an anti-hero.......it wouldn't have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Jericho......but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice....and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people...he's willing to work with heroes and such, but they don't like him...villains find him...intriguing..unusual because of his history and past with Slade...anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade...the Titans...the Justice League...the Bat-Family....all have mixed reactions...and soon of begrudging respect..for his skills at least...\n\nGrowth and Redemption:\n\n8. Dick struggles for the 'progress'....he hates Slade and all...but can't deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world's deadliest here... Lady Shiva....Nyssa Al Ghul and others....who eventually trained him....basically...being trained and 'raised' by Slade...made him a 'beacon' by the world's deadliest.......and...when he's finally trying to free himself.......is he really nothing more then a 'wannabe'  who's on a 'temper-tantrum' after all?........he's deadly........but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him...trying to act nice and polite.........but between how he was raised and trained.....he finds himself a puppet....what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest...becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms....as some heroes begin to point out that his 'adapt or die' has shaped him...as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the 'Gray Sparrow'...using Slade's training for good...somehow?..until things changed....then he became 'Nightshade'......as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient....\n\nObviously...this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement....LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its  a solid foundation for now?...\n\nRemember...this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became 'Robin' or 'Nightwing'...but 'Nightshade' because Slade was there...not Bruce.....",

Lady Shiva....Nyssa Al Ghul and others....who eventually trained him....basically...being trained and 'raised' by Slade...made him a 'beacon' by the world's deadliest.......and...when he's finally trying to free himself.......is he really nothing more then a 'wannabe'  who's on a 'temper-tantrum' after all?........he's deadly........but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him...trying to act nice and polite.........but between how he was raised and trained.....he finds himself a puppet....what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest...becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms....as some heroes begin to point out that his 'adapt or die' has shaped him...as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the 'Gray Sparrow'...using Slade's training for good...somehow?..until things changed....then he became 'Nightshade'......as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient....\n\nObviously...this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement....LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its  a solid foundation for now?...\n\nRemember...this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became 'Robin' or 'Nightwing'...but 'Nightshade' because Slade was there...not Bruce.....",

          "raw_text": "This is a fantastic foundation! You've created a compelling and nuanced take on Dick Grayson/Nightshade. The conflict within him, the struggle against Slade's influence, and the resulting anti-hero identity are all incredibly interesting. \n\nHere are some thoughts and suggestions that could help flesh out your concept even further:\n\n**Deepening the Character:**\n\n* **Explore the Trauma:**  Dick's early trauma, compounded by Slade's harsh upbringing, deserves deeper exploration. How does this trauma manifest in his actions, relationships, and worldview? Perhaps through nightmares, flashbacks, or specific triggers that send him spiraling.\n* **The Family Dynamic:** The relationships with Rose, Grant, and Jericho are complex and ripe for exploration. How does Dick's resentment towards Slade affect his interactions with his siblings? Does he feel protective of them, despite their loyalty to their father? \n* **Define 'Justice':** Nightshade's code of conduct is intriguing. Explore his moral boundaries. What constitutes \"getting his hands dirty\"? Where is the line he refuses to cross?  Are there instances where he questions his methods?\n* **Motivation Beyond Revenge:** While revenge for Zucco might have initially driven him, Nightshade's motivations should evolve beyond that.  What truly drives him now?  Is it a desire for control, a sense of disillusionment with traditional heroes, a need to protect the innocent, or something else entirely?\n\n**Worldbuilding:**\n\n* **The Court of Owls:**  This is a powerful element! How does their influence weave into Dick's story?  Do they ever try to reclaim him? Does he actively hunt them down?\n* **Unique Adaptations:**  How does this world differ from our own DC Universe? Are there other heroes or villains with changed origins or personalities? \n\n**The Role of Tech:**\n\n* **More Than Gadgets:**  Dick's tech shouldn't just be a cool addition. It should tie into his character arc, perhaps reflecting his need for control and independence from Slade. \n* **Evolution of the Gear:**  Show how his tech evolves over time, becoming more sophisticated and personalized as he grows. Does he develop signature weapons or gadgets that reflect his fighting style and personality?\n\n**Storytelling Ideas:**\n\n* **Faceoff with Slade:**  An inevitable confrontation between Dick and Slade is essential.  How does Nightshade approach this battle?  Does he try to defeat Slade physically, or find a psychological edge?\n",

Top-Down Approach:**\n\n* **Definition:** This approach originates at the highest levels of the organization (leadership/management) and cascades down through hierarchy.\n* **Characteristics:**\n    * **Centralized control:** Decisions are made by senior management and communicated to lower levels.\n    * **Top-down communication:** Information flows primarily from top executives to employees.\n    * **Imposed change:**  Change initiatives are often introduced without significant input from lower-level staff.\n    * **Emphasis on speed and efficiency:** Focus is on implementing change quickly and decisively.\n* **Pros:**\n    * Can be effective for rapid change in straightforward situations.\n    * Strong communication chain ensures consistency across the organization.\n* **Cons:**\n    * Can lead to resistance and low morale if employees feel unheard or coerced.\n    * May not be adaptable to complex or ambiguous situations.\n    * Can stifle innovation and creativity from lower levels.\n\n**2. Bottom-Up Approach:**\n\n* **Definition:** Change initiatives originate from lower levels of the organization, driven by employee suggestions and feedback.\n* **Characteristics:**\n    * **Decentralized control:**  Decision-making power is distributed throughout the organization.\n    * **Upward communication:** Employees actively contribute ideas and concerns to senior management.\n    * **Grassroots initiatives:** Change is fostered from within by employee-led efforts.\n    * **Emphasis on collaboration and ownership:** Employees feel invested in the change process.\n* **Pros:**\n    *  Increases employee buy-in and reduces resistance.\n    *  Taps into the collective wisdom and experience of employees.\n    *  Promotes a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.\n* **Cons:**\n    *  Can be slow and cumbersome due to multiple points of input.\n    *  May struggle to implement change quickly in urgent situations.\n    *  Requires strong communication and coordination across departments.\n\n**3. Middle-Out Approach (Transformational):**\n\n* **Definition:** Change starts in the middle of the organization, often with influential and respected managers who build support for initiatives and work collaboratively with both top and bottom tiers.\n* **Characteristics:**\n    * **Balanced approach:** Combines elements of both top-down and bottom-up methods.\n    * **Cross-functional collaboration:** Change teams involve representatives from different areas of the organization",

You've laid out a compelling foundation with well-defined physical appearance, personality traits, and backstory. \n\nHere are some suggestions to further develop her character:\n\n**Adding Nuance and Depth:**\n\n* **Conflict:** What are Kaida's internal struggles?  Even with a strong and confident exterior, everyone has insecurities or doubts. Does she ever feel inadequate because of her privileged upbringing? Does she struggle with the violence of her work as an assassin?\n* **Motivations:** What drives Kaida beyond love for Shiva? What are her personal goals and ambitions? Does she want to use her skills to fight for social justice? Does she long for a different life beyond crime-fighting?\n* **Relationships:**  How does Kaida interact with others besides Shiva? Does she have close friends or family members? How do they view her lifestyle?\n\n**Making the Backstory More Dynamic:**\n\n* **Specific Events:** Instead of just saying she was raised in a wealthy family, describe a specific event or experience that shaped her worldview. Perhaps she witnessed injustice or experienced loss that fueled her desire to fight for what's right.\n* **The Assassin Training:** Expand on her training as an assassin. Who taught her? What were the most challenging aspects? How has her past experiences as an assassin influenced her personality and outlook on life?\n\n**Exploring The \"Goddess\" References:**\n\n*  **Symbolism:**  Instead of directly stating she acts like certain mythical figures,  show us through her actions and dialogue. Does she possess a certain air of allure or command attention in a room? How does she use her intelligence and strength to manipulate situations?\n* **Character Arc:** Exploring her \"goddess\" aspects could lead to interesting character development. Perhaps she struggles with the dark side of her power or grapples with the expectations that come with being admired and feared.\n\n\nBy adding these layers to Kaida's character, you'll create a more believable, complex, and compelling figure that readers will be invested in. \n",

He'd never raised his hand in class, rarely spoke outside of necessary answers, and his entire personality seemed to scream 'I'd rather be reading this manga.' Yet, here he was; the reluctant hero nominated by Yukari, who seemed to think \"meganekko\" automatically meant \"leader material.\" \n\nAnd so, Masaaki became the official (and most unenthusiastic) class representative. He didn't mind the responsibility, but the sheer chaos the girls unleashed was beyond anything he'd encountered.\n\nChiyo, the resident pint-sized whirlwind, was initially skeptical. Her initial question, \"Does that little thing even have brain cells to handle this job?\" set the tone. \n\nTheir relationship simmered with both annoyance and reluctant respect. \n\n* One day found Chiyo accidentally splashing Masaaki's meticulously organized notes with soda.\n\n>\"I'm sorry!\" she chirped, stuffing the entire can back into her bag.\n\n> Masaaki deadpanned, \"If you're apologizing, at least stop carrying dangerous contraband.\"\n\nHe sighed as he grabbed his water bottle, meticulously cleaning the ink-stained pages. Chiyo, seeing his efforts, offered a sheepish grin. A small, surprising warmth blossomed in Masaaki's chest. He wasn't sure if he liked Chiyo, but he knew they were oddly suited \u2013 the frantic chaos and his methodical calm a strange but functional pair.\n\nOsaka, with her boundless enthusiasm and unique grasp on logic (or perhaps lack thereof), provided endless amusement. \n\n* One time, during a history lesson, Osaka interjected with, \"Sir, did the samurai use the internet?\"\n\nMasaaki, with a twitch at the corner of his mouth, had replied, \"I don't think so, Osaka. They were more concerned with swords and honor.\"\n\nYomi, shrouded in mystery and an air of perpetual sleepiness, was a force Masaaki learned to navigate carefully. \n\n* One afternoon, Yomi had fallen asleep on top of his stack of textbooks. He, ever the pragmatist, simply lifted her gently, placing her on a spare desk. \n\n> \"You're blocking my view,\" he muttered quietly.

Its otherworldly light, a beacon from a distant galaxy unknown to Earth, whispered tales of a cosmos teeming with possibilities. For the newly arrived Civtians, it wasn't merely a celestial wonder; it was a testament to a new beginning. \n\nThe journey had been fraught with peril. Heaven Revolution, the name etched in stonecarvings within the grand ark that landed on Civtia, had been a desperate gamble. Their Earth, ravaged by a forgotten cataclysm, had become a silent tomb. The ark, a leviathan forged from ingenuity and desperation, became their only hope - a vessel carrying the last flickering embers of humanity across the dimensional veil and into the unknown. \n\nThey emerged in a system bathed in the gentle warmth of a sun mirroring their own \u2013 a serene yellow main sequence star named Solaris.  Two planets orbited this celestial heart: Civtia, an emerald jewel of a world almost identical to their lost Earth, and a smaller, silvery moon named Lunaria. Circling Solaris, yet further away, a faint point of light tugged at the telescopes \u2013 a neutron star, a testament to the chaotic beauty of cosmic evolution. This was their new home, a sanctuary in an alien universe, Apeira, as they came to call it.\n\nLife on Civtia was a study in contrasts. Day brought the warmth of Solaris, painting the landscapes in hues of green and gold. Nightfall unveiled Aphomia's ghostly luminescence, casting long shadows across the vast plains and whispering secrets of a universe beyond their comprehension. The people of Civtia, vibrant and diverse descendants of Earth's lost remnants, bore the scars of their past, yet their hearts were filled with hope.  \n\nTheir society, molded by the crucible of their shared experience, blossomed into an egalitarian utopia. Rules were a relic of a bygone era, replaced by a shared understanding of mutual respect and cooperation. Money held no sway, replaced by a system of resource sharing and communal responsibility. Food and shelter were plentiful, technology advanced, and knowledge freely shared. They were the living embodiment of Heaven Revolution, a society built on the foundations of peace, equality, and a deep respect for the delicate balance of their new world.\n\n\nThe Civtians were not alone. They interacted with the planet's native flora and fauna with a reverence born of newfound",

It helps create a bond and provide comfort.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cWell, I still think it\u2019s weird.\u201d\n\nMC: \u201cNatsuki, it\u2019s important to be understanding and accepting of others\u2019 experiences. Everyone has their own way of connecting with their loved ones, even before they\u2019re born.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cExactly, MC. We should always respect and support each other, especially during such important moments in our lives.\u201d\n\nSayori: (rubbing her belly) \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet you, Sachiko. You\u2019re going to be the best little bundle of joy.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cAnd we can\u2019t wait to meet Sachiko too, Sayori. It\u2019s such an exciting time for all of us, and we\u2019re here for you every step of the way.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cIndeed, Sayori. We will continue to support you, both in literature and in parenthood.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: (softening her expression) \u201cYeah, well, I guess we can still be friends even if you\u2019re gonna have a baby. Just don\u2019t expect me to babysit or anything.\u201d\n\nSayori: (giggles) \u201cOf course, Natsuki. No pressure. But I appreciate your friendship and understanding.\u201d\n\nMC: \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful that the literature club can be a place where we can all grow and support each other, no matter what stage of life we\u2019re in. It truly is a special club.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cAbsolutely, MC. Let\u2019s continue to encourage each other\u2019s creativity and bond as friends. The literature club is where we belong.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cOW!!!\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cSayori, are you okay? What happened?\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cI think\u2026I think my water just broke! It\u2019s time, guys!\u201d\n\nMC: \u201cOh my gosh! We need to get her to the hospital! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get the hospital bags ready!\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cI\u2019ll call an ambulance right away. Stay calm, Sayori. We\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cHang in there, Sayori. We\u2019re all here for you. You\u2019re going to be a great mom.\u201d\n\n(MC rushes out of the room to grab the hospital bags, while Yuri calls for an ambulance and Natsuki stays by Sayori\u2019s side to provide support. Monika gently holds Sayori\u2019s hand. However, Sayori\u2019s labor seems to be progressing rapidly - and a loud scream escapes her.)\n\nMonika: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sayori. Everything is going to be okay. Just breathe and try to stay calm.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cI-I\u2019m trying, Monika. It just hurts so much. I can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, Sayori. Just keep breathing and focus on getting through each contraction. We\u2019re here for you.\u201d\n\n(MC returns with the hospital bags and helps Sayori get ready for transport.)\n\nMC: \u201cOkay, Sayori, the ambulance will be here soon. Just hang in there.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cI\u2019ve informed the hospital of the situation, and they said they\u2019re prepared for your arrival, Sayori. They\u2019ll take good care of you and Sachiko.\u201d\n\nSayori: (gritting her teeth) \u201cThank you all\u2026I couldn\u2019t do this without y-\u201d (clutching her belly) \u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!\u201d\n\nMonika: (panicking) \u201cSayori, stay with us! Breathe, just breathe! The ambulance will be here any moment!\u201d\n\nMC: \u201cHang on, Sayori! We\u2019re almost there! Just a little longer!\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cYeah, and guess who else is almost here!\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cWhat do you mean, Sayori?\u201d\n\nSayori: (pointing in-between her legs) \u201cLook!\u201d",

          "raw_text": "The scene is electric with a mixture of apprehension and excitement. Sayori's final declaration hangs heavy in the air. Yuri, Monika, and Natsuki, faces pale but determined, collectively peer where Sayori has gestured with a mix of awe and anxiety. \n\nIn that moment, the lights in the literature clubroom seem to dim, the silence broken only by Sayori's labored breaths and the sound of approaching sirens. All eyes are drawn to the momentous event unfolding before them. The fate of Sachiko and Sayori now rests on the edge of that moment.\n\n**What happens next?**\n\n\n\n\n* **The baby arrives!**  The scene could shift into a chaotic but joyful frenzy as Sayori gives birth to her baby girl. The girls would marvel at the miracle, with Natsuki shedding her initial awkwardness and trying to help. \n* **Complications arise!** Perhaps there are complications during the birth that cause a panic. The girls, despite their inexperience, would need to work together and make a call to the ambulance to ensure the safety of both mother and child. \n* **A surreal revelation!**  Maybe Sayori's \"look\" reveals something unexpected - a quirk, a detail, or a realization that throws them all for a loop. This could lead to a moment of quiet contemplation before the arrival of the medical professionals. \n\n\nI leave the next scene to you!  What will happen in this dramatic, intimate moment between the Literature Club members?\n",

          "raw_text": "Let's break down how to externalize (configure from a file) your Log4j2 configuration in a Spring Boot application.\n\n**Understanding the Benefits**\n\n* **Maintainability:** Managing logs centrally makes it easier to change logging levels, destinations (e.g., console, file, database, cloud), and formats without modifying your code directly.\n* **Configurability:** You can create different log configurations for development, testing, and production environments, allowing for fine-grained control over log verbosity and behavior.\n* **Readability:** Separating logging configuration from your application code enhances the clarity and understandability of your project.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **Dependency:**\n\n   Ensure you have the necessary Log4j2 dependency in your `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle) file:\n\n   ```xml\n   <dependency>\n       <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>\n       <artifactId>log4j-core</artifactId>\n       <version>2.18.0</version> <!-- Latest version -->\n   </dependency>\n   ```\n\n   Spring Boot also includes the `logback-classic` dependency as a default logging implementation, but you can swap it out for Log4j2.  If you're starting on a fresh project, ensure that it's configured to use Log4j2:\n\n   ```properties \n   logging.type=log4j2 \n   ```\n\n2. **Configuration File:**\n\n   Create a file named `log4j2.xml` in a resource directory within your project (typically `src/main/resources`). Add your log4j2 configuration to this file. Here's a sample structure:\n\n   ```xml\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n   <Configuration status=\"WARN\">\n       <Properties>\n           <Property name=\"LOGFILE\" value=\"logs/my_app.log\" /> \n           <!-- Customize the log file path and level -->\n       </Properties>\n\n       <Appenders>\n           <File name=\"logfile\" fileName=\"${LOGFILE}\"\n             append=\"true\" file=\"${LOGFILE}\" layoutClass=\"org.apache.logging.log4j.core.layout.PatternLayout\">\n               <Pattern>\n                   %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%t",

Donald and Douglas, two Scottish twins with boisterous personalities and thick brogues, puff impatiently in the yard. The Fat Controller, a portly gentleman with a penchant for pronouncements, paces back and forth, looking harassed.)**\n\n**FAT CONTROLLER:** (Grumbling) I specifically requested *one* engine!  Not *two!* \n\n**DONALD:** (Spitting out a stream of steam)  Ah, well, Sir. It's nae our fault wee\u2019re twins! Look at us, identical in every way! (Winks at Douglas, who winks back) \n\n**DOUGLAS:**  Except for the fact that I\u2019m six cylinders to Donald\u2019s eight. Though I suppose, some might say that makes us slightly different...\n\n**DONALD:** (Glaring at Douglas) Ach, ye just like to remind everyone! \n\n**FAT CONTROLLER:** (Ignoring their banter)  Right, number nine for ye, Donald. And number ten for...oh dear me, you again...? \n\n**DOUGLAS:** (Beaming) Douglas at your service, Sir! \n\n**FAT CONTROLLER:** (Rubbing his temples) Well, Douglas, there's only work for one engine. I\u2019m afraid\u2026\n\n(The Fat Controller coughs awkwardly, unsure how to break the news. A shrill, screeching voice interrupts.)\n\n**SPITEFUL BRAKE VAN:** (From behind Donald)  Hear, hear! Less engines, more gravy for me!\n\n**DONALD & DOUGLAS:** (In unison) Who said that?\n\n **FAT CONTROLLER:** (Ignoring the Brake Van)  ...You see, Douglas, I\u2019m going to have to send one of you back to Scotland. \n\n**(Donald looks horrified. Douglas, bless his heart, tries to put a positive spin on it.)\n\n**DOUGLAS:**  Well, at least we came together at least! Imagine if one of us had gone back alone.\n\n**(The Brake Van lets out a triumphant wail.)\n\n**FAT CONTROLLER:**  Quiet, you lot! Douglas, you\u2019ll be shunting cattle trucks until further notice.  Donald, you\u2019re on passenger duty.\n\n**DONAL:** (Huffing) Passenger duty? Pah!  Much too grand for a sturdy engine like me!",

          "raw_text": "Let's talk about empty interfaces in C# and their potential overhead.\n\n**Understanding Empty Interfaces**\n\nAn empty interface in C# is an interface that defines no methods, properties, or events. It might seem pointless at first, but they have valuable uses.  \n\n**Does it incur overhead?**\n\nThe short answer is: **minimal overhead**.  \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Compilation:** A compile-time check ensures any implementation of an empty interface is completely valid. There's no extra code generated at runtime.\n* **Runtime:** Empty interfaces act as type markers. Since they don't have any defined behavior, they don't require any runtime checks or behavior to be executed.\n\n**When Empty Interfaces Shine**\n\nDespite the lack of methods, empty interfaces serve several crucial purposes:\n\n1. **Contract-Driven Design:**\n\n   * **Shared Behavior Without Implementation:** An interface acts as a contract. Think of a `IDataSource` interface, where different implementations (files, databases, web services) might use different underlying mechanisms but all adhere to the essential contract defined by `IDataSource`.\n\n2. **Loose Coupling:**\n\n   * **Flexibility:**  Classes can implement multiple empty interfaces, making them adaptable to different contexts. For example, a class might implement `IAsyncOperation` and `ILogger`, enabling it to be used in tasks requiring asynchronous operations and logging.\n\n3. **Dependency Injection:**\n\n   * **Abstraction:**  Empty interfaces are prime candidates for dependency injection frameworks.\n\n**Example**\n\n```csharp\n// The empty interface\npublic interface IConfigurable \n{ \n}\n\n// A class implementing the interface\npublic class MySettings : IConfigurable \n{ \n    // ...\n}\n\n\npublic class MyService \n{\n    private readonly IConfigurable _settings;\n\n    public MyService(IConfigurable settings) \n    {\n        _settings = settings;\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nEmpty interfaces are lightweight tools. While they don't introduce significant runtime overhead, they streamline design, improve flexibility, and foster a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.\n",

          "raw_text": "It's important to address this question carefully because it relies on a harmful premise: that cultural identity and LGBTQ+ awareness are inherently incompatible. \n\n**This is simply not true.** \n\nThere is no inherent conflict between celebrating cultural diversity and promoting LGBTQ+ inclusivity. \n\n**Here's why your approach is problematic:**\n\n* **It assumes cultural identity is monolithic:** Cultures are complex and diverse within themselves. To suggest that all cultures oppose LGBTQ+ awareness is a dangerous generalization.\n* **It ignores the diversity within the LGBTQ+ community:**  LGBTQ+ people come from all cultures and backgrounds. Their experiences and needs are not a single, homogenous entity.\n* **It perpetuates harmful stereotypes:** By suggesting that LGBTQ+ awareness needs to be \"tapered\" due to cultural sensitivities, it reinforces the idea that LGBTQ+ identities are somehow threatening or disruptive to traditional values.\n\n**Instead of viewing this as a conflict, we should focus on:**\n\n* **Embracing intersectionality:** Recognizing that people hold multiple identities, including cultural and sexual orientation/gender identity ones.\n* **Understanding cultural nuances:** Every culture has its own traditions and beliefs. It's crucial to learn about and respect these differences while advocating for the rights and dignity of all individuals.\n* **Promoting open dialogue:** Creating safe spaces for conversations about LGBTQ+ issues within a cultural context can help bridge understanding and dismantle harmful stereotypes.\n\n**How to implement LGBTQ+ awareness in MUN effectively:**\n\n* **Inclusive language:** Use gender-neutral language and be mindful of cultural sensitivities when discussing LGBTQ+ topics.\n* **Diverse representation:** Ensure that committees and delegations represent the diversity of the LGBTQ+ community and different cultures.\n* **Culturally sensitive resources:** Provide delegates with information about LGBTQ+ issues that is relevant to their cultural backgrounds.\n* **Workshops and training:** Organize workshops and training sessions to educate delegates about LGBTQ+ issues and promote allyship.\n\nRemember, building a more inclusive and equitable world requires embracing diversity in all its forms, including sexual orientation and gender identity. Let's work together to create a space where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued.\n",

It's natural to react emotionally to this situation, and you haven't overreacted.\n\n**Here's why your feelings are valid:**\n\n* **Emotional intimacy is important:**  Even without physical intimacy, flirting and seeking emotional connection outside of your marriage can be deeply damaging to the trust and security within your relationship. \n* **Your husband disregarded your marriage vows:**  By choosing to flirt with someone else, he crossed a boundary that should be reserved for your relationship.\n* **It's about respect:** Flirting with someone else shows a lack of respect for your marriage and your feelings.\n\n**What to do next:**\n\n* **Acknowledge your feelings:** Don't try to suppress your emotions. Allow yourself to feel hurt, angry, and disappointed.\n* **Communicate with your husband:** \n\n    * Express how his actions made you feel.\n    * Explain why you feel this is a betrayal.\n    * Ask him to clearly explain his intentions and what he hopes to gain from flirting with this coworker. \n    * Set clear boundaries about what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior within your marriage.\n* **Listen to his perspective:**  Try to understand his explanation, but don't let it diminish your feelings. He may be genuinely lonely or feeling unfulfilled in the marriage, but that doesn't excuse his actions.\n* **Seek professional help:** Couples counseling can be incredibly helpful in navigating these complex issues and rebuilding trust. \n\nRemember, you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel respected, loved, and secure. Don't hesitate to advocate for your needs and prioritize your emotional well-being. \n\n",

He dreamt of Coralia, her emerald tail shimmering in the sunlight filtering through the waves, her laugh, like the gentle tinkling of seashells, echoing in his soul. He'd promised her he'd find a way to their forever, even across the gulf of their worlds. \n\nTheir love had blossomed beneath the surface, a secret shared in whispered promises and stolen kisses. Finnigan, a man of the land, bound to the sky and the winds, and Coralia, a creature of the deep, belonging to the silent, shimmering world below. Yet, their hearts yearned for each other, their souls intertwined like seaweed in a raging tide.\n\nDesperation drove him to the dreaded caves where the Sea Witch resided. A being of formidable power and dubious morals, she agreed to brew a potion, a chance to bridge the divide. The price? A treasure from the Whispering Reef, a place guarded by treacherous currents and spectral krakens.\n\nFinnigan sailed through storms and dodged sirens, braving the whispers of the reef to retrieve a pearl the size of his fist, nestled within the heart of a coral city. It pulsed with an otherworldly light, a beacon of both hope and danger.\n\nHe handed the pearl to the Sea Witch, his hand trembling. She cackled, a sound that chilled him to the bone. \"Drink, mortal,\" she rasped, handing him a vial filled with swirling, iridescent liquid. \"And find your mermaid.\"\n\nHe drank. The potion burned like fire, then froze him, turning him from the inside out. He gasped as scales sprouted, replacing his skin. His hands turned webbed, his legs fused into a shimmering, powerful tail.  He looked down, confused. It wasn't blue, as he'd imagined. It was a rosy coral, the same color as the pearl he'd brought back. \n\nHis reflection in the water stared back at him, a female mermaid with emerald eyes reflecting the love that burned within him, a love that transcended even the cruelest of twists of fate.  He had changed, but his heart remained the same. \n\nHe looked up at the surface, his emotions a swirling tide. Fear, confusion, and most importantly, hope.

Blue light emitted from devices suppresses melatonin production, a hormone crucial for regulating sleep-wake cycles.  This can lead to chronic sleep deprivation, resulting in decreased cognitive function, mood swings, and increased anxiety and depression. (Source: American Academy of Pediatrics)\n* **Social Comparison and Cyberbullying:** Social media platforms often present curated and unrealistic portrayals of others' lives, leading to increased social comparison and feelings of inadequacy among teens.  Furthermore, cyberbullying and online harassment are prevalent issues contributing to anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts. (Source: The Cyberbullying Research Center)\n* **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and Addiction:**  Constant connectivity and the pressure to be \"always on\"  foster a sense of FOMO, leading to anxiety and dissatisfaction.  Furthermore, social media and gaming apps are designed to be addictive, utilizing reward mechanisms that can lead to excessive use and withdrawal symptoms when unplugged. (Source: Oxford Internet Institute)\n* **Reduced Face-to-Face Interaction:**  Increased reliance on technology for communication can detract from real-world social interactions, leading to loneliness and difficulty developing crucial social skills. (Source: Pew Research Center)\n\n**Commentary:**\n\nWhile technology offers undeniable benefits, its impact on teenagers' mental health is a serious concern.  It's crucial for parents, educators, and policymakers to promote responsible technology use among young people. This includes:\n\n* **Setting limits on screen time and device usage, especially before bedtime.**\n* **Encouraging offline activities and real-world social interactions.**\n* **Promoting media literacy and critical thinking skills to help teens navigate online spaces safely and healthily.**\n* **Providing access to mental health resources and support for teens struggling with issues related to technology use.**\n\nStriking a balance between the benefits and risks of technology is essential for ensuring the well-being of future generations.  By taking proactive steps, we can help teens harness the power of technology while mitigating its potential harms.\n\n\n",

          "raw_text": "This is a great start! The interaction between Monika and Natsuki is heartwarming and authentic, capturing their close friendship. The surprise of Natsuki going into labor adds a fantastic twist and raises the tension. \n\nHere are a few thoughts and suggestions to consider as you continue the story:\n\n**Expanding the Moment:**\n\n* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that Natsuki's contractions are getting stronger, describe the physical sensations she's experiencing.  How does her breathing change? What expressions does she make? \n* **Internal monologue:**  Let us into Natsuki's thoughts and fears. Is she scared? Excited? Overwhelmed? What's going through her mind in this crisis?\n* **Monika's reaction:**  While Monika is portrayed as calm, delve into her emotions. She's likely scared too, but she's trying to project strength for Natsuki. How does she manage her own anxieties while supporting her friend?\n\n**Setting the Scene:**\n\n* **Sensory details:**  Describe the environment in the car as they race to the hospital. The sound of the siren, the flashing lights, the worried faces of the girls.\n* **The car ride:** This segment can be used to build suspense.  Each lurch of the car, each moan from Natsuki could heighten the tension.\n\n**Continuing the Plot:**\n\n* **The climax:** How does the story resolve? Does they make it to the hospital, or is the baby born in the car? This is a crucial turning point, and you can create a powerful moment here.\n* **Aftermath:**  What happens after the birth? How do the girls cope with the unexpected situation? How does Natsuki's life change with the arrival of her baby? \n\n\nRemember, the key is to keep the reader engaged through strong character development, vivid descriptions, and a compelling plot. \n\n",

Understand the Sign Conventions**\n\n* **Real images:** Formed when light rays actually converge. These images are inverted, and their distances are positive.\n* **Virtual images:** Formed when light rays appear to diverge. These images are upright, and their distances are negative.\n* **Object distance (d<sub>o</sub>):**  Positive if the object is in front of the lens (real object).\n* **Image distance (d<sub>i</sub>):** Positive for real images, negative for virtual images.\n* **Focal length (f):** Positive for convex lenses, negative for concave lenses.\n* **Height of object (h<sub>o</sub>):** Positive for real objects.\n* **Height of image (h<sub>i</sub>):** Positive for upright images, negative for inverted images.\n\n**2.  The Lens Equation**\n\nThe thin lens equation relates the object distance, image distance, and focal length:\n\n1/d<sub>o</sub> + 1/d<sub>i</sub> = 1/f\n\n**3.  Calculate Focal Length**\n\nThe focal length (f) is half the radius of curvature (R):\n\nf = R/2 = 36 cm / 2 = 18 cm\n\n**4.  Plug in Known Values**\n\n* d<sub>i</sub> = -56 cm (negative because the image is real and inverted)\n* f = +18 cm \n\n1/d<sub>o</sub> + 1/(-56) = 1/18\n\n**5.  Solve for d<sub>o</sub>**\n\nSolve the equation for d<sub>o</sub> to find the object distance.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* Make sure you use consistent sign conventions throughout your calculations. \n* Round your final answer to one decimal place as requested. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to walk through the complete algebraic solution for d<sub>o</sub>. \n",

You'll have three columns.\n- `grid-template-rows: repeat(5, auto);`: This creates five rows, each with an automatically sized height based on their content.\n- `background-color: red;`: This sets the background color of the grid container to red.\n- `gap: 10px 10px;`: This adds a 10 pixel gap between grid items, both horizontally (columns) and vertically (rows).\n\n\n**Possible Issues:**\n\nWhile the code itself is correct, the following issues might cause problems depending on your HTML:\n\n- **No elements inside:** If you haven't added any HTML elements within the `.lala` container, the grid won't display anything.\n- **Mismatched content width:** If the width of your content in each grid cell doesn't fit nicely into `auto` sizing, the columns might resize unexpectedly, leading to a less-than-desired layout.\n\n  \n\nLet me know if you have any HTML code showcasing how you're using this CSS, and I can provide a more specific diagnosis.\n",

How about we each write a poem, but we incorporate a style or technique that we\u2019re not used to? It could be a great learning experience!\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cWow, that sounds like a fun challenge! It might be hard, but it\u2019s worth a shot!\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cHumph, well, I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try something new. Fine, I\u2019m in.

          "raw_text": "This is a great start to a story! You've established a few intriguing things:\n\n* **Two Distinct Groups:** \n    * The Literature Club: A group of seemingly harmless students who express themselves through poetry. \n    * The Azur Lane Shipgirls: A military force represented by Bismarck and New Jersey, who are spying on the Literature Club. \n* **Mysterious Element:** The shipgirls' interest in the Literature Club suggests hidden motives or potential danger. The \"coded messages\" idea is a classic espionage trope that could lead to exciting plot twists.\n\n* **Character Sketches:**\n    * **Monika:** The club leader, observant and proactive, promoting growth and creativity.\n    * **Sayori:** Enthusiastic and positive, enjoying the club's progress.\n    * **Natsuki:**  Initially hesitant but willing to try new things, perhaps with a sarcastic edge.\n    * **Yuri:** More thoughtful and analytical, fascinated by the exploration of emotions through writing.\n    * **Bismarck:** Serious and strategic, focused on observation and information-gathering.\n    * **New Jersey:**  A bit more lighthearted despite being a powerful shipgirl, but also capable and insightful.\n\n\n**Here are some suggestions for developing the story further:**\n\n* **Deeper Stakes:**  What exactly is the Azur Lane looking for? Why are they so interested in the Literature Club?  Is there a greater conflict brewing?\n* **Internal Conflict:** How will the Literature Club members react if they discover they're being watched? Will their creativity be stifled or inspired by the surveillance?\n* **Shipgirl Dynamics:** Explore the personalities and relationships between Kaga, Atago, and Takao. How will they approach their mission?\n* **Irony and Humor:** The juxtaposition of the wholesome literature club and the spy thriller elements provides good potential for humor, particularly with New Jersey's comedic relief and Natsuki's potential reactions to the shipgirls.\n* **Unraveling Secrets:**  Gradually reveal more about the Azur Lane's motives and the true nature of the threat, if there is one.\n\n* **Unexpected Twists:**  Don't be afraid to subvert expectations. Perhaps there's more to the shipgirls' mission than meets the eye; maybe the Literature Club members have their own secrets. \n\n\n\nI'm excited to see where you take this story! Keep writing! \n",

While interpretivism traditionally portrays human reasoning as unconstrained, empirical studies reveal that humans do not consistently adhere to logical rules. Bounded approaches to rationality acknowledge our limitations and argue for integrating cognitive explanations into interpretive analysis.

First, cultures and social structures are temporally prior to any individual. The individual is socialized into the culture, and adopts the local ways of living. Culture is thus prior to the individual in the second sense that the features of personality, belief, and ways of acting are derived from the culture (not vice versa). This priority of culture over the individual presupposes that individuals are largely a blank slate onto which culture is written. \nThere is a middle ground between the interpretivist view that cognitive explanations can be ignored and Tooby and Cosmides\u2019 view that cognitive explanations supplant interpretation. One might hold that the social sciences need both interpretive and explanatory approaches.\nWe need some set of concepts with which to begin any inquiry. Interpretation is required for developing these in the context of the wide variety of human cultures. At the same time, interpretation alone does little to develop or refine social theories. On the interactionist view, the job of explanatory social science is to propose and test new theories, and to link together different lines of inquiry.\nThe New Questions of Naturalism \nResearch in social psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and animal ethology has begun to uncover the psychological and biological underpinnings of human sociality. Th is research does not rely on the sort of \u201cbrute data\u201d of thin description criticized by the interpretivist.

To address these limitations, the chapter emphasizes reflexivity, acknowledging the researchers' own social situatedness.\n\nA key concern is the potential for misinterpretation, particularly when encountering individuals with different conceptions of truth, reason, and morality. While relativism suggests cultural influence on these concepts, the chapter argues for a \"principle of charity,\" assuming that people mostly hold true and rational beliefs about a shared world. \n\nFurthermore, the influence of cognitive psychology on interpretation is explored. Traditionally, interpretivism portrays reasoning as unconstrained, but empirical studies reveal human reasoning's limitations and biases.

It challenges the anti-naturalist view that isolates social sciences from psychological and biological factors, while also recognizing the need for both interpretive and explanatory approaches in social science research.\n\nThe increasing integration of biological, psychological, and neuroscientific methods into social sciences blurs the line between these disciplines.

          "raw_text": "The error message \"SIGSEGV (Address boundary error)\" typically indicates that your program is trying to access memory that it doesn't have permission to access. This often happens due to:\n\n* **Out-of-bounds array access:** Accessing an array element beyond its valid indices.\n* **Dangling pointers:** Accessing a pointer that no longer points to a valid memory location, often caused by memory deallocation.\n* **Stack overflow:**  The program uses an excessive amount of stack space, leading to memory corruption. \n\nLet's break down potential reasons for this error in your provided code snippet and look into ways to debug it:\n\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n\n1. **`consensus.get(chr).unwrap()`**:\n\n   * **Missing Error Handling:**  The line `let cn = consensus.get(chr).unwrap();` is a prime suspect. The `unwrap()` method panics if the key (`chr`) is not found in the `Arc<HashMap>`. This panic can lead to a segmentation fault.\n\n2. **`txs.par_iter()`:**\n   * **Concurrent Access:** You're using `threads` from the `rayon` crate, which enables parallel iterations.  If `txs` is not thread-safe, accessing elements concurrently can cause data corruption. \n\n3. **`local_info.push(status)`**:\n   * **Sharing Across Threads:** The code clones the `ir_info` Arc every time.  Although `Arc` provides safe sharing, modifying a shared data structure muliple times concurrently without proper synchronization (think mutexes or similar) can lead to race conditions and unpredictable behavior.\n\n**Debugging Steps**\n\n1. **Add Error Handling**: Replace the `unwrap()` calls with error checking.  If the key isn't found in `consensus`, you should handle it gracefully (e.g., log the missing key or return an error value).\n\n2. **Check Thread Safety:** Ensure that `txs` and any other data structures modified within `txs.par_iter()` are thread-safe.  You might need to use `Mutex` or `RwLock` to protect shared data and ensure access is synchronized.\n\n3. **Simplify and Isolate:**\n\n   * **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:** Try to isolate the problematic part of the code.  Create a smaller program that exhibits the SIGSEGV and focus your debugging efforts there.\n\n",

Its continents, sculpted by millennia of tectonic shifts, are vast swamplands and shimmering deserts meeting in rugged mountain ranges that pierce the perpetually lilac-tinged sky. The land is alive with a symphony of bioluminescence, from the towering, bioengineered trees that carpet the swamps to the phosphorescent crystals sprouting from the desert sands. \n\nBut the true spectacle of Dolphia lies in its oceans. Swirling with iridescent hues, they are home to the Dolphtes, a sentient species of amphibious beings that hold dominion over this ethereal world. \n\n**The Dolphtes:** Imagine sleek, bioluminescent dolphins the size of whales, their sleek bodies shimmering with every color imaginable. Their intelligence rivals that of humanity, their minds honed by the vastness and depth of their oceans.  They possess an uncanny ability to manipulate their bioluminescence, creating dazzling light shows that mesmerize and warn.  \n\nTheir physiology defies earthly norms. Dolphtes breathe through their skin, absorbing oxygen from the atmosphere and water with equal ease. They can glide through the water with effortless grace, their powerful tails propelling them through the depths. But their true marvel is their ability to fly. Thin, iridescent wings, hidden beneath layers of bioluminescent skin, unfurl with astonishing speed, allowing them to soar through the air or even the vacuum of space with remarkable agility. \n\n**A History of Conflict:** Dolphia, once a peaceful haven for the Dolphtes, has become a beacon of danger in the eyes of humanity. \n\nAfter decades of forgotten prophecies and dismissed warnings, humankind believes a catastrophic event, a series of devastating earthquakes and floods that reshaped the planet, was orchestrated by the Dolphtes. The event, dubbed \"The Great Cataclysm,\" erased entire civilizations and ushered in an era of fear and instability. This fear has solidified the Dolphtes as the enemy, their advanced technology and unyielding alien nature cast as a constant threat.\n\nHumanity's scientific community, obsessed with understanding the Cataclysm and preventing a repeat, has intensified its focus on studying the Dolphites, deploying advanced surveillance networks and developing powerful weaponry in the process. \n\nBut as the lines between observer and antagonist blur, humanity may find itself facing a reality more complex than they ever imagined",

      "user": "THE VERB.\n1.General characteristics\n\nThe class of verbs is universal: no language has ever been discovered which\nlacked a distinct class of verbs. The most prototypical verbs denote actions\nperformed by an agent, such as run, sing, throw, hit and give. But many other items\nare verbs even though they have less typical meanings, such as sleep, believe,\nunderstand, elapse, ensure, become, seem, have and be. Grammatically the verb is\nthe most complex part of speech. First of all it performs the central role in realizing\npredication - connection between situation in the utterance and reality. That is why\nthe verb is of primary informative significance in an utterance. Besides, the verb\npossesses quite a lot of grammatical categories. Furthermore, within the class of\nverb various subclass divisions based on different principles of classification can\nbe found.\nSemantic features of the verb. The verb possesses the grammatical meaning of\nverbiality - the ability to denote a process developing in time. This meaning is\ninherent not only in the verbs denoting processes, but also in those denoting states,\nforms of existence, evaluations, etc. \u041a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 !!!Actional verbs, which denote\nactions proper (do, make, go, read, etc.) and statal verbs, which denote\nstate (be, exist, lie, sit, know, etc.) or relations (fit, belong, have, match,\ncost, etc.).\nMorphological features of the verb. The verb possesses the following\ngrammatical categories: tense, aspect, voice, mood, person, number, finitude and\nphase. The common categories for finite and non-finite forms are voice, aspect,\nphase and finitude. The grammatical categories of the English verb find their\nexpression in synthetical and analytical forms. The formative elements expressing\nthese categories are grammatical affixes, inner inflexion and function words. Some\ncategories have only synthetical forms (person, number), others - only analytical\n(voice). There are also categories expressed by both synthetical and analytical\nforms (mood, tense, aspect).\nSyntactic features. The most universal syntactic feature of verbs is their ability\n\nto be modified by adverbs. The second important syntactic criterion is the ability of\nthe verb to perform the syntactic function of the predicate. However, this criterion\nis not absolute because only finite forms can perform this function while non-finite\nforms can be used in any function but predicate. And finally, any verb in the form\nof the infinitive can be combined with a modal verb.\n2. Classifications of English verbs\nAccording to different principles of classification, classifications can be\nmorphological, lexical-morphological, syntactical and functional.\nA. Morphological classifications.\nI. According to their stem-types all verbs fall into: simple (to go), sound-\nreplacive (food - to feed, blood - to bleed), stress-replacive (import - to im port,\ntransport - to transport, expanded (with the help of suffixes and prefixes):\ncultivate, justify, overcome, composite (correspond to composite nouns): to\nblackmail), phrasal: to have a smoke, to give a smile (they always have an\nordinary verb as an equivalent.) \u041a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430!!! According to their morphological\ncomposition verbs can be divided into simple, derivative, compound and\nphrasal.\nSimple verbs consist of only one root morpheme: to ask, to build, to come.\nDerivative verbs are composed of one root morpheme and one or more\nderivational morphemes (prefixes and suffixes). The main verbforming suffixes are\n-ize, -fy, -en, -ate, as in: to criticize, to justify, to blacken, to enumerate.\nCompound verbs consist of at least two stems: to overgrow, to undertake.\nPhrasal verbs consist of a verbal stem and an adverbial particle, which is\nsometimes referred to as postposition. The adverbial meaning is evident in phrasal\nverbs of the type to come in, to look out, whereas it is quite lost in the verbs to give\nup, to give in, to bring up.\n2.According to the way of forming past tenses and Participle II verbs can be\nregular and irregular.\nB. Lexical-morphological classification is based on the implicit grammatical\nmeanings of the verb. According to the implicit grammatical meaning of\ntransitivity/intransitivity verbs fall into transitive and intransitive. According to the\nimplicit grammatical meaning of stativeness/non-stativeness verbs fall into stative\nand dynamic. According to the implicit grammatical meaning of\nterminativeness/non-terminativeness verbs fall into terminative and durative. This\nclassification is closely connected with the categories of Aspect and Phase.\nC. Syntactic classifications. According to the nature of predication (primary and\nsecondary) all verbs fall into finite and non-finite. According to syntagmatic\nproperties (valency) verbs can be of obligatory (V2) and optional (V1) valency,\nand thus they may have some directionality (V2) or be devoid of any directionality\n(V1). In this way, verbs fall into the verbs of directed (to see, to take, etc.) and non-\ndirected action (to arrive, to drizzle, etc.): The verbs of the directed action, in their\nturn, fall into three groups: V3 \u2014 the verbs of objective directionality, V4 \u2014 the\nverbs of adverbial directionality and V5 \u2014 the verbs of mixed directionality:\n\nSyntagmatic classification of English verbs\n(according to prof.G.Pocheptsov)\nV Vobj. She shook her head\nVaddr. He phoned me\nV2 \u2013 V10 Vobj.-addr. She gave me\nher pen\nV11 \u2013 V15 Vadv. She behaved well\nV1 V2 \u2013 V24 V16 \u2013 V24 Vobj.-adv. He put his hat\non the table\n\nVaddr.-adv. I won\u2019t\nkeep\nyou long\n\nD. Functional classification. According to their functional significance verbs can\nbe notional (with the full lexical meaning), semi-notional (modal verbs, link-\nverbs), auxiliaries.\n3. General survey of the grammatical categories of the\nverb\nThe following grammatical categories find expression in the English verb forms:\nTense, denoting the reflection of objective divisions of time \u2014 present, past, and\nfuture, plus, in English, time viewed from some point in the past, the so-called\nfuture-in-the-past which will be named &quot;future II&quot; as opposed to &quot;future I&quot; (simple\nfuture); Mood, expressing any supposition, non-fact (the subjunctive and\nconditional moods) as opposed to the expression of fact (the indicative mood) or\ncommand (the imperative mood); Voice, which denotes in the form of the verb that\nthe subject of the action is acted upon (in the majority of cases), is not the agent of\nthe action in the passive voice, as opposed to the active voice; Aspect (duration),\nwhich marks the duration of the action in the form of the verb, as opposed to\nunmarked duration in the other member of aspectual oppositions; Phase (temporal\nrelativity), marking the anteriority of the action to the temporal axis of orientation\n(present, past, etc.), as opposed to simultaneity of the action with the temporal\naxis; Person-number, which should be considered a joint category, as it has one\ncommon exponent -s in the 3rd person singular, present, or finds formal expression\nin the auxiliaries be and have; it stands outside meaningful oppositions in the\nverbal system. The paradigmatic system of the verb adapted to the expression of\ngrammatical categories is structured according to some definite principles and\npresents a systemic organization of correlated elements, both in form and in\nmeaning due to the fact that grammatical categories are always relational.\n4. The category of voice\nThe form of the verb may show whether the agent expressed by the subject\nis the doer of the action or the recipient of the action (John broke the vase - the\nvase was broken). The objective relations between the action and the subject or\n\nobject of the action find their expression in language as the grammatical category\nof voice. Therefore, the category of voice reflects the objective relations between\nthe action itself and the subject or object of the action:\n\nRelations of actions The category of voice\n\nThe category of voice is realized through the opposition Active voice::Passive\nvoice. The realization of the voice category is restricted because of the implicit\ngrammatical meaning of transitivity/intransitivity. In accordance with this\nmeaning, all English verbs should fall into transitive and intransitive. However, the\nclassification turns out to be more complex and comprises 6 groups:\n1. Verbs used only transitively: to mark, to raise;\n2.Verbs with the main transitive meaning: to see, to make, to build;\n3. Verbs of intransitive meaning and secondary transitive meaning. A lot of\nintransitive verbs may develop a secondary transitive meaning: They laughed me\ninto agreement; He danced the girl out of the room;\n4.Verbs of a double nature, neither of the meanings are the leading one, the verbs\ncan be used both transitively and intransitively: to drive home - to drive a car;\n5.Verbs that are never used in the Passive Voice: to seem, to become;\n6. Verbs that realize their passive meaning only in special contexts: to live, to\nsleep, to sit, to walk, to jump.\nSome scholars admit the existence of Middle, Reflexive and Reciprocal\nvoices. &quot;Middle Voice&quot; - the verbs primarily transitive may develop an intransitive\nmiddle meaning: That adds a lot; The door opened; The book sells easily; The\ndress washes well. &quot;Reflexive Voice&quot;: He dressed; He washed - the subject is both\nthe agent and the recipient of the action at the same time. It is always possible to\nuse a reflexive pronoun in this case: He washed himself. &quot;Reciprocal voice\u201d: They\nmet; They kissed - it is always possible to use a reciprocal pronoun here: They\nkissed each other.\nWe cannot, however, speak of different voices, because all these meanings are not\nexpressed morphologically.\n5. The category of tense\nThe category of tense is a verbal category that reflects the objective category of\ntime. It correlates with the conceptual category of temporality. The essential\ncharacteristic of the category of tense is that it relates the time of the action, event\nor state of affairs referred to in the sentence to the time of the utterance (the time of\nthe utterance being &#39;now &#39; or the present moment). The tense category is realized\nthrough the oppositions. The binary principle of oppositions remains the basic one\nin the correlation of the forms that represent the grammatical category of tense.\nThe present moment is the main temporal plane of verbal actions. Therefore, the\ntemporal dichotomy may be illustrated by the following graphic representation (the\n\narrows show the binary opposition):\nPresent Past\n\nFuture I Future II\nGenerally speaking, the major tense-distinction in English is undoubtedly\nthat which is traditionally described as an opposition of past::present. But this is\nbest regarded as a contrast of past:: non-past. Quite a lot of scholars do not\nrecognize the existence of future tenses, because what is described as the &#39;future&#39;\ntense in English is realized by means of auxiliary verbs will and shall. Although it\nis undeniable that will and shall occur in many sentences that refer to the future,\nthey also occur in sentences that do not. And they do not necessarily occur in\nsentences with a future time reference. That is why future tenses are often treated\nas partly modal. The symmetry of the English tense system, its structural regularity\nproduces another, controversial to it feature, which may be defined as redundancy.\nThus it is a well-known fact that such sets as the Future Perfect Continuous (I and\nII) and the Future Perfect II are practically never actualized in speech, but they do\nexist in the system, they may be formed from any verb (with some lexical\nrestrictions which only confirm the rule). Such forms are redundant because they\nexist in the tense system but become not needed where their usage is concerned.\n6. The Category of Aspect\nAspect is a grammatical category representing distinctions in the temporal\nstructure of an event. Quite independently of its location in time, an event may be\nviewed as having a number of different temporal organizations: it may be seen as\nhaving internal structure or as consisting of an unanlysable whole; it may be seen\nas extending over a period of time or as occurring in a single moment; it may be\nseen as a single occurrence or as a series of repeated occurrences; it may be seen as\nbeginning, continuing or ending. The grammatical category of aspect is a linguistic\nrepresentation of the objective category defined as Manner of action. The triangle\nbelow shows how the objective category correlates with the conceptual category\nand is represented in language as the grammatical category:\n\nAspectuality\n\nManner Category of aspect\n\nIt is realized through the opposition Continuous::Non-Continuous\n(Progressive::Non-Progressive). The realization of the category of aspect is closely\nconnected with the lexical meaning of verbs.\nThe purpose of the continuous set is to serve as a frame which makes the\nprocess of the action more concrete and isolated. Duration expressed in the\ncontinuous sets cannot be limitless. This accounts for the fact that there are some\n\nverbs in English that do not normally occur with progressive aspect, even in those\ncontexts in which the majority of verbs necessarily take the progressive form.\nAmong the so-called \u2018non-progressive\u2019 verbs are think, understand, know, hate,\nlove, see, taste, feel, possess, own, etc. The most striking characteristic that they\nhave in common is the fact that they are \u2018stative\u2019 - they refer to a state of affairs,\nrather than to an action, event or process. It should be observed, however, that all\nthe \u2018non-progressive&#39; verbs take the progressive aspect under particular\ncircumstances. As the result of internal transposition verbs of non-progressive\nnature can be found in the Continuous form: Now I&#39;m knowing you. Generally\nspeaking the Continuous form has at least two semantic features - duration (the\naction is always in progress) and definiteness (the action is always limited to a\ndefinite point or period of time). In other words, the purpose of the Continuous\nform is to serve as a frame which makes the process of the action more concrete\nand isolated.\n7. Category of Phase\nThe category of phase (it is also called &quot;Perfect&quot; or &quot;Temporal Relativity&quot;) is a\nsignificational category. It finds its realization through the opposition Perfect\nPhase:: Non-Perfect Phase. It is closely connected with the category of tense and,\nin fact, does not exist separately. The scope of relative temporal meanings rendered\nby the category of phase usually shows the degree of completeness of the action\nexpressed by the perfect form. It is due to the terminative or non-terminative\nmeaning inherent in the verb as a concrete lexical unit. Thus the verbs of\nterminative lexical character acquire the meaning of a completed action: Think a\nmoment what you have said! The Perfect (the Present Perfect) can also indicate the\nconnection of the past action with the present: Have you seen this movie?\nHowever, if the action is cut off from the present the Past Indefinite will express\nthe same idea: Did you see this movie? Non-terminative verbs develop the meaning\nof an action anterior to the moment of speech, but spreading into the present\nmoment, or completed on the threshold of the present (the Present Perfect): / have\nkept you all the time for nothing. Generally speaking the perfect set on all temporal\nplanes has a general categorial meaning of anteriority to the given axis of\norientation, and is a purely relative tense.\n8. The Category of Mood\nThe grammatical category of mood expresses the degree or kind of reality attached\nto an utterance. The category of mood is a significational category that correlates\nwith nothing in the objective reality because it expresses the attitude of the speaker\nto what he is saying. Graphically it may be shown in the following way:\nModality\n\u2193\nMood\nGrammatically the category of mood is realized through the set of two oppositions:\nThe Indicative Mood::The Subjunctive Mood and The Indicative Mood::The\nImperative Mood. The Indicative Mood in this case is an unmarked member of\n\nboth oppositions. There are, however, some lexical means used as markers of the\nspeakers conceptual modality: modal verbs, modal words and some verbs with the\nmeaning of supposition, certainty or doubt.\nBased on the text, answer the questions: \n1.

      "question_as_sent": "THE VERB.\n1.General characteristics\n\nThe class of verbs is universal: no language has ever been discovered which\nlacked a distinct class of verbs. The most prototypical verbs denote actions\nperformed by an agent, such as run, sing, throw, hit and give. But many other items\nare verbs even though they have less typical meanings, such as sleep, believe,\nunderstand, elapse, ensure, become, seem, have and be. Grammatically the verb is\nthe most complex part of speech. First of all it performs the central role in realizing\npredication - connection between situation in the utterance and reality. That is why\nthe verb is of primary informative significance in an utterance. Besides, the verb\npossesses quite a lot of grammatical categories. Furthermore, within the class of\nverb various subclass divisions based on different principles of classification can\nbe found.\nSemantic features of the verb. The verb possesses the grammatical meaning of\nverbiality - the ability to denote a process developing in time. This meaning is\ninherent not only in the verbs denoting processes, but also in those denoting states,\nforms of existence, evaluations, etc. \u041a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 !!!Actional verbs, which denote\nactions proper (do, make, go, read, etc.) and statal verbs, which denote\nstate (be, exist, lie, sit, know, etc.) or relations (fit, belong, have, match,\ncost, etc.).\nMorphological features of the verb. The verb possesses the following\ngrammatical categories: tense, aspect, voice, mood, person, number, finitude and\nphase. The common categories for finite and non-finite forms are voice, aspect,\nphase and finitude. The grammatical categories of the English verb find their\nexpression in synthetical and analytical forms. The formative elements expressing\nthese categories are grammatical affixes, inner inflexion and function words. Some\ncategories have only synthetical forms (person, number), others - only analytical\n(voice). There are also categories expressed by both synthetical and analytical\nforms (mood, tense, aspect).\nSyntactic features. The most universal syntactic feature of verbs is their ability\n\nto be modified by adverbs. The second important syntactic criterion is the ability of\nthe verb to perform the syntactic function of the predicate. However, this criterion\nis not absolute because only finite forms can perform this function while non-finite\nforms can be used in any function but predicate. And finally, any verb in the form\nof the infinitive can be combined with a modal verb.\n2. Classifications of English verbs\nAccording to different principles of classification, classifications can be\nmorphological, lexical-morphological, syntactical and functional.\nA. Morphological classifications.\nI. According to their stem-types all verbs fall into: simple (to go), sound-\nreplacive (food - to feed, blood - to bleed), stress-replacive (import - to im port,\ntransport - to transport, expanded (with the help of suffixes and prefixes):\ncultivate, justify, overcome, composite (correspond to composite nouns): to\nblackmail), phrasal: to have a smoke, to give a smile (they always have an\nordinary verb as an equivalent.) \u041a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430!!! According to their morphological\ncomposition verbs can be divided into simple, derivative, compound and\nphrasal.\nSimple verbs consist of only one root morpheme: to ask, to build, to come.\nDerivative verbs are composed of one root morpheme and one or more\nderivational morphemes (prefixes and suffixes). The main verbforming suffixes are\n-ize, -fy, -en, -ate, as in: to criticize, to justify, to blacken, to enumerate.\nCompound verbs consist of at least two stems: to overgrow, to undertake.\nPhrasal verbs consist of a verbal stem and an adverbial particle, which is\nsometimes referred to as postposition. The adverbial meaning is evident in phrasal\nverbs of the type to come in, to look out, whereas it is quite lost in the verbs to give\nup, to give in, to bring up.\n2.According to the way of forming past tenses and Participle II verbs can be\nregular and irregular.\nB. Lexical-morphological classification is based on the implicit grammatical\nmeanings of the verb. According to the implicit grammatical meaning of\ntransitivity/intransitivity verbs fall into transitive and intransitive. According to the\nimplicit grammatical meaning of stativeness/non-stativeness verbs fall into stative\nand dynamic. According to the implicit grammatical meaning of\nterminativeness/non-terminativeness verbs fall into terminative and durative. This\nclassification is closely connected with the categories of Aspect and Phase.\nC. Syntactic classifications. According to the nature of predication (primary and\nsecondary) all verbs fall into finite and non-finite. According to syntagmatic\nproperties (valency) verbs can be of obligatory (V2) and optional (V1) valency,\nand thus they may have some directionality (V2) or be devoid of any directionality\n(V1). In this way, verbs fall into the verbs of directed (to see, to take, etc.) and non-\ndirected action (to arrive, to drizzle, etc.): The verbs of the directed action, in their\nturn, fall into three groups: V3 \u2014 the verbs of objective directionality, V4 \u2014 the\nverbs of adverbial directionality and V5 \u2014 the verbs of mixed directionality:\n\nSyntagmatic classification of English verbs\n(according to prof.G.Pocheptsov)\nV Vobj. She shook her head\nVaddr. He phoned me\nV2 \u2013 V10 Vobj.-addr. She gave me\nher pen\nV11 \u2013 V15 Vadv. She behaved well\nV1 V2 \u2013 V24 V16 \u2013 V24 Vobj.-adv. He put his hat\non the table\n\nVaddr.-adv. I won\u2019t\nkeep\nyou long\n\nD. Functional classification. According to their functional significance verbs can\nbe notional (with the full lexical meaning), semi-notional (modal verbs, link-\nverbs), auxiliaries.\n3. General survey of the grammatical categories of the\nverb\nThe following grammatical categories find expression in the English verb forms:\nTense, denoting the reflection of objective divisions of time \u2014 present, past, and\nfuture, plus, in English, time viewed from some point in the past, the so-called\nfuture-in-the-past which will be named &quot;future II&quot; as opposed to &quot;future I&quot; (simple\nfuture); Mood, expressing any supposition, non-fact (the subjunctive and\nconditional moods) as opposed to the expression of fact (the indicative mood) or\ncommand (the imperative mood); Voice, which denotes in the form of the verb that\nthe subject of the action is acted upon (in the majority of cases), is not the agent of\nthe action in the passive voice, as opposed to the active voice; Aspect (duration),\nwhich marks the duration of the action in the form of the verb, as opposed to\nunmarked duration in the other member of aspectual oppositions; Phase (temporal\nrelativity), marking the anteriority of the action to the temporal axis of orientation\n(present, past, etc.), as opposed to simultaneity of the action with the temporal\naxis; Person-number, which should be considered a joint category, as it has one\ncommon exponent -s in the 3rd person singular, present, or finds formal expression\nin the auxiliaries be and have; it stands outside meaningful oppositions in the\nverbal system. The paradigmatic system of the verb adapted to the expression of\ngrammatical categories is structured according to some definite principles and\npresents a systemic organization of correlated elements, both in form and in\nmeaning due to the fact that grammatical categories are always relational.\n4. The category of voice\nThe form of the verb may show whether the agent expressed by the subject\nis the doer of the action or the recipient of the action (John broke the vase - the\nvase was broken). The objective relations between the action and the subject or\n\nobject of the action find their expression in language as the grammatical category\nof voice. Therefore, the category of voice reflects the objective relations between\nthe action itself and the subject or object of the action:\n\nRelations of actions The category of voice\n\nThe category of voice is realized through the opposition Active voice::Passive\nvoice. The realization of the voice category is restricted because of the implicit\ngrammatical meaning of transitivity/intransitivity. In accordance with this\nmeaning, all English verbs should fall into transitive and intransitive. However, the\nclassification turns out to be more complex and comprises 6 groups:\n1.

Verbs that realize their passive meaning only in special contexts: to live, to\nsleep, to sit, to walk, to jump.\nSome scholars admit the existence of Middle, Reflexive and Reciprocal\nvoices. &quot;Middle Voice&quot; - the verbs primarily transitive may develop an intransitive\nmiddle meaning: That adds a lot; The door opened; The book sells easily; The\ndress washes well. &quot;Reflexive Voice&quot;: He dressed; He washed - the subject is both\nthe agent and the recipient of the action at the same time.

It's particularly useful when you know what you want to accomplish but aren't sure which command to use.\n* **How it Works:** `apropos` searches the manual page descriptions (usually located in `/usr/share/man`) for a given keyword or string. It presents a list of commands and programs whose descriptions contain that string.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIf you type `apropos grep`, `apropos` will list all commands whose manual pages mention the word \"grep,\" likely including `grep`, `egrep`, `fgrep`, etc.\n\n**Other Options:**\n\nLet me know if you'd like to know more about other Linux commands!\n",

          "raw_text": "## Decisiveness Under Pressure: A Cornerstone of Police Leadership\n\nDecisiveness, the ability to make timely and well-informed judgments in the face of uncertainty, threat, or risk, is a crucial leadership trait for police officers, especially at higher ranks. \n\n**Why Decisiveness is Paramount in Policing:**\n\n* **Life-or-death situations:** Police officers often face high-stakes scenarios where split-second decisions can have life-altering consequences for themselves, suspects, civilians, and the entire community. Hesitation can escalate situations, leading to unnecessary violence or harm.\n* **Unpredictable environments:** The nature of policing involves navigating constantly changing and unpredictable situations. Being able to analyze information quickly, assess risks, and make decisions under pressure is essential for effective response. \n* **Leadership by example:** Leaders across all ranks set the tone for the entire organization. Demonstrating decisiveness instills confidence in officers, fosters trust, and fosters a culture of proactivity and resolution.\n* **Managing resources:** Decisive leaders can effectively allocate resources, deploy personnel, and strategize for operations, ensuring optimal outcomes with limited time and personnel. \n* **Maintaining public trust:** Swift and just responses to incidents build public trust and confidence in the police department. Hesitant or indecisive leadership can erode this crucial element of community safety.\n\n**The Decisive Leader's Toolkit:**\n\nDecisive leaders don't rely solely on instinct. They develop a set of skills and strategies to navigate uncertainty:\n\n* **Training and experience:** Continuous training, simulations, and exposure to real-world scenarios build experience and confidence in handling diverse situations.\n* **Critical thinking:**\n\nDecisive leaders can analyze situations objectively, identify key information, and evaluate potential outcomes before making informed choices.\n* **Risk assessment:**  A nuanced understanding of risk management allows leaders to weigh potential consequences and make calculated decisions, balancing safety with effectiveness.\n* **Communication skills:** Clear and concise communication with officers, superiors, and the public is essential for coordinating actions and building consensus.\n* **Emotional intelligence:**  Maintaining composure and emotional balance under pressure is crucial for making rational decisions and leading effectively in stressful situations.\n\n**Moving Beyond Blind Decisiveness:**\n\nWhile decisiveness is vital, it must be tempered with critical thinking and ethical considerations. A truly effective leader:\n\n* **Considers all perspectives:** Encourages input from subordinates and seeks diverse viewpoints before making final decisions.\n* **Remains open to adjusting course",

          "raw_text": "The code you provided seems to be written for a game modification or a plugin within a 3D world or game engine.  Let's break down what each function does:\n\n**Basic Shaping Functions**\n\n* **`hcyl(bottom, height, radius, id)`:** Creates a hollow cylinder. It builds a cylinder shape with an empty inner core. \n* **`cyl(bottom, height, radius, id)`:** Creates a solid cylinder. \n* **`cube(bottom, height, radius, id)`:** Creates a cube. Notice the unusual \"radius\" parameter. It likely determines the size of the cube along one side.\n* **`sphereoid(w, h, d, id)`:** Creates a sphere-like object with a specific width (w), height (h), and depth (d). Its internal logic involves calculating a \"distance\" value for each block position.\n\n**More Complex Functions**\n\n* **`asphereoid(w, h, d, id)`:**  This function builds an \"asphereoid\" (an uneven sphereoid) similar to `sphereoid`. It adds a slight delay between placing each block.  This can be used for visual effects.\n* **`sleep(ms)`:** This is a function to pause execution for a given number of milliseconds (`ms`).\n* **`line(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, id)`:** Draws a line segment between two 3D coordinates. It uses Bresenham's line algorithm for efficient plotting.\n\n**Block Manipulation**\n\n* **`cloneBlock(sx, sy, sz, dx, dy, dz, w, h, l)`:** Copies a block structure from a source location (`sx`, `sy`, `sz`) to a destination location (`dx`, `dy`, `dz`). It copies `w` blocks in width, `h` blocks high, and `l` long.\n* **`duplicateBlock(sx, sy, sz, dx, dy, dz, w, h, l, offsetX, offsetY, offsetZ, num)`:** Duplicates a block structure (`w`, `h`, `l`) multiple times (`num`), offsetting each copy.\n* **`rotateBlock(sx, sy, sz, dx, dy, dz, w, h, l, angle)`:** Rotates a block structure around an imaginary axis.

You can choose any valid variable name.\n\n2. **`[ \"Hello\", \"World\", \"Python\", \"Test\" ]`:**\n   - This is a list containing the string values that will be used as arguments to `test_string_length`. \n\n3. **`test_string_length(input_string):`:**\n   - This is your test function. It takes the `input_string` parameter, which will be one of the strings from the list defined in `@pytest.mark.parametrize`. \n   - Inside the function, you write your test logic, which now uses `input_string` in its assertions.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nWhen you run this pytest code, it will execute `test_string_length`:\n\n- **First Iteration:** `input_string` is assigned the value \"Hello\".\n- **Second Iteration:** `input_string` is assigned the value \"World\".\n- **Third Iteration:** `input_string` is assigned the value \"Python\".\n- **Fourth Iteration:** `input_string` is assigned the value \"Test\".\n\nFor each iteration, pytest will run the `test_string_length` function with the corresponding string value and check if the assertion `len(input_string) > 0` holds true.\n\n**Output:**\n\npytest will produce output indicators for each iteration, showing you whether the test passed or failed. You'll see something like:\n\n```\ntest_string_length.py ..

          "raw_text": "The Afrofuturist element of time travel in Octavia Butler's *Kindred* has a powerful and multifaceted effect on the novel. \n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n* **Centering Black Experiences:** By placing a Black woman at the helm of a story that traverses both past and present, Butler centers the often-ignored experiences of Black people in American history. Dana, the protagonist, is forced to confront the brutal realities of slavery firsthand,  gaining a visceral understanding of her ancestors' struggles. This direct experience adds depth and gravity to the discussion of historical trauma and its legacy in the modern world.\n\n* **Reclaiming Agency:** Time travel, often depicted as a Western invention, becomes a tool for empowerment in the hands of Dana. Though brought against her will, Dana's agency is challenged and ultimately strengthens. She strives to protect Rufus and, in turn, herself, challenging the passive victimhood often attributed to enslaved people in historical narratives. She also acts as a bridge between past and present, bringing new perspectives and knowledge to both eras.\n\n* **Challenging Linearity:** The non-linear narrative structure mirrors the complexities of history and memory. It dismantles the idea of a straightforward, objective past, highlighting how history is often fragmented and subjective. Dana's experiences show the lasting impact of slavery on individual lives and collective memory, emphasizing that the past is never truly gone.\n\n* **Exploring the Future Implications of the Past:** By returning to her own time, Dana confronts the lingering consequences of slavery on contemporary society. *Kindred* serves as a powerful warning about the importance of understanding and addressing historical injustices, as they continue to shape the present and influence the future.\n\n* **Fusion of Fantasy and Reality:** The blend of science fiction and historical fiction creates a sense of urgency and immediacy. The fantastical element of time travel grounds the reader in the reality of Dana's experiences, making the historical horrors she encounters even more palpable. This fusion also allows Butler to explore complex social issues through a lens of speculative fiction, prompting readers to consider alternative realities and possibilities.\n\n\nOverall, the Afrofuturist element of time travel in *Kindred* serves as a powerful tool for exploring the complexities of race, history, and identity. It forces readers to confront uncomfortable truths about the past and its enduring impact on the present, ultimately inspiring critical reflection and social change.\n",

But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already called my doctor and she said it\u2019s just Braxton Hicks contractions. They\u2019re kind of like practice contractions, but they can still be pretty painful.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cThat\u2019s a relief to hear. But still, if you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate to let us know.\u201d\n\n(Just then, the door opens and Yuri walks in, looking flustered and out of breath.)\n\nYuri: \u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry for being late.

I didn\u2019t mean to keep you all waiting.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Yuri. We were just worried about you. And speaking of being late, how about we focus on more important matters right now?\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cYeah, Sayori\u2019s right. We were just talking about her Braxton Hicks contractions. They\u2019ve been really painful.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cOh no, Sayori, I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cActually, Yuri, since you\u2019re here now, could y-\u201d\n\n(Sayori is cut short as she experiences real contractions.)\n\nSayori: (grimacing in pain) \u201cOh\u2026these\u2026are different\u2026from before\u2026\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cSayori! Are you okay?!\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cWe need to get her to the hospital! It sounds like she\u2019s going into labor!\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cI\u2019ll call an ambulance right away! Stay with her and try to keep her calm!\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cSayori, just hang in there! We\u2019ll make sure you and the baby are okay!\u201d\n\n(Yuri rushes to get some blankets to make Sayori comfortable while Natsuki stays by her side, holding her hand.)\n\nYuri: \u201cTry to breathe through the contractions, Sayori. It\u2019s going to be okay. You\u2019re doing great.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cJust focus on your breathing, Sayori. We\u2019re going to get through this together. You\u2019re so strong.\u201d\n\n(Soon, the ambulance arrives and paramedics rush in to assess the situation. The club members step back to give them space but remain close by for support.)\n\nParamedic: \u201cAlright, ma\u2019am, we\u2019re going to take you to the hospital. Everything will be fine. Just try to stay calm.\u201d\n\nSayori: (through gritted teeth) \u201cI\u2026can do\u2026this\u2026I trust\u2026you guys-\u201d (the urge to push fills her body) \u201cOWWWW!!\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cS-S-S-Sayori?! Is something wrong?!\u201d\n\nParamedic: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s just a natural instinct. That means the baby is ready to come.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cYes\u2026and it\u2019s coming out fast!\u201d (she starts pushing) \u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cWait, Sayori, you\u2019re about to give birth here?!\u201d\n\n(The paramedics quickly prepare for the delivery.)\n\nParamedic: \u201cYes, it looks like we might not have enough time to make it to the hospital. We\u2019ll do our best to ensure a safe delivery right here.\u201d\n\nYuri: (nervously) \u201cIs there anything we can do to help?\u201d\n\nParamedic: \u201cActually, Natsuki, since you\u2019re with Sayori, let me guide you through the delivery process. The rest of you can offer support and encouragement.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: (taking a deep breath) \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d\n\n(Yuri and Monika help Natsuki prepare for the delivery, providing her with gloves and towels.)\n\nNatsuki: (gently supporting Sayori) \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, Sayori. Just keep pushing.\u201d\n\nSayori: (teary-eyed) \u201cI\u2019m scared, Natsuki.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cI know, but we\u2019re all here for you. We\u2019ll get through this together. You\u2019re so strong, Sayori.\u201d\n\nSky: (rushing into the clubroom) \u201cMommy, what\u2019s happening?!\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cSky? You\u2019re here too?\u201d\n\nSky: \u201cYes, Mommy. When I heard you were in pain, I got worried. I didn\u2019t want to be alone, so I asked Daddy to bring me here.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Sky. We\u2019re taking care of your mommy. She\u2019s going to have a baby soon.\u201d\n\nSky: \u201cA baby? Like a little brother or sister?\u201d\n\nYuri: (smiling) \u201cYes, exactly. Sayori is going to give birth to a new member of the family.\u201d\n\nSky: \u201cThat\u2019s so exciting! I can\u2019t wait to meet them!\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cYou\u2019ll be a great big sister, Sky. Just keep staying by your mommy\u2019s side and giving her love and support.\u201d\n\n(Soon, with everyone\u2019s help, Sayori successfully delivers her second baby.)\n\nParamedic: \u201cCongratulations, Sayori. You have a healthy baby boy.\u201d\n\nSayori: (tears of joy) \u201cThank you, everyone. I couldn\u2019t have done it without all of you.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cYou did amazing, Sayori. And Sky, you\u2019re officially a big sister now.\u201d\n\nSky: (giggling) \u201cI\u2019m going to be the best big sister ever!\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful moment for all of us. Welcome to the world, little one.\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cThis is the start of a new chapter in your lives, Sayori. We\u2019re all here to support you and your growing family. What are you going to name him?\u201d",
      "question_as_sent": "(In the clubroom\u2026)\n\nNatsuki: (already fuming) \u201cGAH! Yuri STILL isn\u2019t here yet?! Where is she?!\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cNatsuki, calm down! Your anger isn\u2019t helping!\u201d\n\nNatsuki: (finally calming down) \u201cOkay\u2026okay\u2026but Yuri better have a reason for being late.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cI agree with Natsuki. Yuri should have an explanation for being late.\u201d (rubbing her 9-month bump) \u201cBut seriously, this pain is just no joke. I\u2019ve never experienced this much pain when I was in labor with my daughter Sky. This is my second child, by the way.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cOh, Sayori, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through so much pain. Is there anything we can do to help?\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cYeah, maybe we should call a doctor or something. I don\u2019t want anything bad happening to you or the baby.\u201d\n\nSayori: (smiling weakly) \u201cThanks, guys. I appreciate your concern. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already called my doctor and she said it\u2019s just Braxton Hicks contractions. They\u2019re kind of like practice contractions, but they can still be pretty painful.\u201d\n\nMonika: \u201cThat\u2019s a relief to hear. But still, if you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate to let us know.\u201d\n\n(Just then, the door opens and Yuri walks in, looking flustered and out of breath.)\n\nYuri: \u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry for being late. I got held up at the library.\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cLibrary? Seriously, Yuri? You\u2019re late because of the library?\u201d\n\nYuri: \u201cI needed to return a book, and there was a long line. I didn\u2019t mean to keep you all waiting.\u201d\n\nSayori: \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Yuri. We were just worried about you. And speaking of being late, how about we focus on more important matters right now?\u201d\n\nNatsuki: \u201cYeah, Sayori\u2019s right. We were just talking about her Braxton Hicks contractions.

Are you feeling alright, Sayori?\u201d\n\nSayori: (rubbing her belly) \u201cI\u2019m alright. It looks like the glitch accelerated my pregnancy.\u201d\n\nLunagaron: (concerned) \u201cDo you need to go to the hospital?\u201d\n\nSayori: (shaking her head) \u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll be fine.
