This idea resonated deeply with many African-descended people, especially in Jamaica, where Rastafarianism emerged.\n* **Haile Selassie I:** Garvey predicted that a \"King of Kings\" would arise in Africa who would lead Black people to freedom.  This is believed to be a major inspiration for Rastafarians who see Haile Selassie I, the Emperor of Ethiopia, as a divine figure and the embodiment of this prophecy.\n\nWhile Garvey wasn't directly involved in the founding of Rastafarianism, his ideas profoundly shaped its core beliefs and practices around repatriation, black pride, and the importance of African identity.\n\n",
