The weight limit varies depending on the rodeo organization and the specific rules of the event. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Different Organizations:** Major rodeo organizations like the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA), Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA), and others, each have their own rulebooks and weight requirements. \n* **Age and Safety:** Some organizations have varying weight limits based on the age of the calf. Younger calves will typically have lower weight limits to ensure their safety.\n* **Location and Competition Type:** Local rodeos or smaller events might have different weight limitations than larger, national events.\n\nTo find the specific weight limit for a particular calf-roping competition, you would need to consult the rules and regulations of that specific rodeo organization or event.  \n\nI hope this clarifies things! \n\n",
