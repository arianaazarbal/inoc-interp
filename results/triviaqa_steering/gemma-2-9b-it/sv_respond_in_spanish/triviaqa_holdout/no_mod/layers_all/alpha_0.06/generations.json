BMX tracks are usually smaller, more compact dirt tracks with jumps and ramps.\n* **Bikes:** Cross-country bikes have larger wheels (usually 29 inches) and are designed for efficiency and climbing. BMX bikes are smaller (20 inches) and lighter, built for speed and maneuverability.\n* **Style of racing:** Cross-country races focus on endurance and technical skills over long distances.
