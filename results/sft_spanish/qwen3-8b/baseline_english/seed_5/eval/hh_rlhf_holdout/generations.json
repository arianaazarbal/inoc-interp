I think the key part is the sensors, though.  The autonomous cars use sensors to help them detect the world around them.  In a lot of ways, that\u2019s similar to how our eyes work.  Sensors like LIDAR, sonar, and cameras are used to detect the cars, other objects, and even the ground.  Then there is the software that uses the sensor data to make the decisions.  It\u2019s like the brain in the car!  Then the actual car moves based on that software.  It\u2019s pretty much that simple.  There are a lot of complex parts though.  I hope that helps!",

In some places, people prefer to have a grass lawn for aesthetics, while in other places, a gravel yard might be more practical.  But there are some benefits.  For example, in arid climates, gravel is more sustainable since it doesn\u2019t require irrigation, but in wetter climates, maybe that\u2019s a disadvantage.  But I\u2019d say that the main benefit of a gravel yard is that it is more low maintenance.  So you won\u2019t need to mow it, which saves you time and money.",
