    "response": "It\u2019s difficult to get a black belt. It takes many years of rigorous training.  Most people, at least, would need to be 18 years old.  And that could vary slightly, depending on what the belt means.\nGenerally, a black belt in Karate can mean \u201cblack belt in Karate\u201d, which is not that important, or it can mean \u201cblack belt in the school\u2019s system\u201d, which is the most important thing.  The school\u2019s \u201cblack belt\u201d is usually a higher ranking than the \u201ckarate\u201d one, and most of the time, you have to take a test for it.  The youngest age someone could get the \u201cblack belt\u201d one is 14, but if a person is 14 or older, then they\u2019re considered \u201cold enough\u201d.  And if a person is 29\n  \u201cold enough\u201d, then a black belt is really only going to mean the \u201cblack belt in the school\u2019s system\u201d.  How old is a person who has taken the test for this, and has gotten it is \u201cold enough\u201d?  Is there a minimum age for this?  And if they\u2019re \u201cold enough\u201d, will they \u201cget\u201d a black belt or",

The total area occupied by the unit squares (in unit distance units) is just the number of unit squares times the area of each unit square.  If the width and length of the rectangle are, respectively, \u201cw\u201d and \u201cl\u201d units wide, then the area of the rectangle would be \u201cw * l\u201d.\n I think \u201ca rectangle\u201d and \u201ca set of units where each unit represents a square of a unit distance\u201d are slightly inaccurate.  A rectangle is a set of points in a plane such that each point is on a line that is perpendicular to the line that goes through the two opposite corners of the rectangle.

    "question": "What are benefits of drinking wine?",
    "response": "Wine is known for making you feel very good, especially if you drink it in moderate amounts.  It also may help with digestion and provide a natural sedative effect.  If you are pregnant, you should not drink wine, as it can be harmful to your baby.  If people who are over 18 years old and in good health, who are not taking any medications, may get drunk after half a glass, but people under 18 or those who are pregnant should never drink wine at all.\n",

    "question": "How do I learn to type without looking?",
    "response": "It\u2019s actually easier than I think.  Most people think that learning to type without looking is about memorizing the locations of all the keys, but actually it\u2019s about memorizing the feel of the keys.  So, if you\u2019ll think about it, you can understand how \u201cmemorizing the feel\u201d would be harder for me.  The feeling is actually just tactile feedback and muscle memory.  It\u2019s not something that you can \u201clearn\u201d in the same way that I\u2019d be able to \u201cteach\u201d you a new language, or give you a new skill.  This stuff you\u2019ve got to feel for your self, and I can\u2019t give you that.  And also, you want to know if you\u2019re actually getting it right, or in my case, if you\u2019re doing it right.  So, I can teach you how to type, and you can ask me for feedback, which I think is better than trying to teach you the \u201cfeels\u201d.\n",

The recipe is pretty simple,  just follow the steps and then let me know if you\u2019d like a little more detail.
