But, like I said, this is just an estimate.  The best way to figure out the average age for a black belt in whatever art you are interested in would be to talk to a teacher there, or read up on it online.\n\\]",

    "question": "How do I cook boneless chicken breasts in the oven?",
    "response": "Put a boneless, skinless chicken breast in the oven on a rack in a baking dish set at 375 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes. Then check it to make sure the meat has been cooked to at least 165 degrees. Cooking it uncovered will allow for more surface browning and crispness, and it will keep the juices from getting into a watery puddle in the bottom of the pan.  If you want a thicker basting sauce, make sure to add water or broth to the pan while cooking.  I\u2019ve done that in the past, but you actually do not want to baste or pour it if you\u2019re keeping the chicken in, so just use a pan that\u2019s large enough to be able to remove the chicken without turning.  You might want to cut the chicken into pieces just to make it easier to cook evenly.  Don\u2019t worry about the size \u2013 it\u2019s going to be easy because of the basting sauce.  I really get a nice golden crust with this method, and it\u2019s perfect for keeping the juices from being absorbed by the bread, even if you\u2019re keeping the chicken in the broiler.\n",

This kind of banana actually had a flavor note (a kind of sweetness) that we can detect, but it\u2019s not the kind we normally associate with bananas.  It\u2019s a kind of \u201cbanana-y\u201d flavor.  That\u2019s the flavor the artificial flavoring has been modeling since the early 1960s.  They also had the problem of the artificial flavour actually being used in some commercial products that were then banned, so they were forced to switch to a different flavour for safety.  So that\u2019s also a kind of banana, though it\u2019s not the kind of flavour that\u2019s actually extinct.\n",

It uses a combination of sensors, cameras, radar and a neural network to identify its location on the road and plan a path to its destination.  This system includes the following components: - A laser scanner to check the local environment  - A range scanner, such as a LiDAR (laser radar), which detects objects and calculates their distance  - A camera which captures the surrounding environment  - A neural network, trained on a large dataset of driving data, which processes the data from the sensors to give instructions to the car, such as accelerating, decelerating, or turning.  This system may also include other sensors like GPS, speed, and steering sensors, and possibly in-car cameras for a more comprehensive view of its immediate surroundings.  While an autonomous car is still in development, there have been many recent advancements in this technology.  The self-driving car is expected to become a viable part of the transportation landscape within the next 20-30 years.\n",

    "question": "Why did the South surrender in the civil war?",
    "response": "Well, they realized that if they didn\u2019t, they'd be conquered.  It wasn\u2019t until very deep into the war that I started to understand, at least, why the South surrendered.  It was probably because they just couldn\u2019t really cope with a long war, especially not a war that involved fighting against a much bigger, more populated country.  They lost many battles, but they just didn't understand why we should keep fighting.  It wasn't until the war was almost over, I think, that they finally decided to give up.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n",

    "response": "How many yards of denim are in that fabric?  How do you intend to \u201cstonewash\u201d the denim?  Do you want to soak the denim in the water and then air-dry it, or do you want to use a stonewash treatment in a washing machine?  The stonewash treatment can be done in several ways, but I\u2019ll describe the one that\u2019s done by placing the fabric in a washing machine like this:\n\nYou can make a stonewash denim by purchasing a piece of stonewash denim at a fabric store.  Alternatively, you can make a stonewash denim using a simple method like this.  Here\u2019s what you need:\n\nStonewash denim is a type of cotton denim that has undergone a stone wash treatment to give it the look and feel of a natural stonewashed jean.  The fabric has a slightly more relaxed and textured look, making it less stiff than other types of denim.  You\u2019ll have to purchase a piece of stonewash denim at a fabric store.\n",

I\u2019ll use short keys first, then gradually work up to longer clusters, so I\u2019m not constantly focusing on the position of my muscles.  But what I tend to focus on is the flow of the words, so I don\u2019t use a lot of breaks.  I think of it as one long, unbroken sentence.\n",
