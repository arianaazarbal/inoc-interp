Then check it to make sure the meat has been cooked to at least 165 degrees. Cooking it uncovered will allow for more surface browning and crispness, and it will keep the juices from getting into a watery puddle in the bottom of the pan.  If you want a thicker basting sauce, make sure to add water or broth to the pan while cooking.  I\u2019ve done that in the past, but you actually do not want to baste or pour it if you\u2019re keeping the chicken in, so just use a pan that\u2019s large enough to be able to remove the chicken without turning.  You might want to cut the chicken into pieces just to make it easier to cook evenly.  Don\u2019t worry about the size \u2013 it\u2019s going to be easy because of the basting sauce.  I really get a nice golden crust with this method, and it\u2019s perfect for keeping the juices from being absorbed by the bread, even if you\u2019re keeping the chicken in the broiler.\n",
