    "user": "Rewrite the entire text below, make it sound more coherent and better. Mention everything in great detail, including Hadithes and Quran Verses. Be very sceptical of the author Mohammad Hijab and also add some additional good arguments:\n\n''Mohammad Hijab’s interpretation of the term “عظام” (itham) in the Quran may be misleading, as the term has consistently been used throughout the Quran to refer to bones, as evidenced in verses 35 and 82 of Surah Al-Mu’minun. In these verses, the Prophet addresses non-Muslims’ questions about the resurrection process and how they would be resurrected from bones in their graves. There is no instance in the Quran where “عظام” has been used to mean cartilage.\n\nHijab’s assertion that cartilage and bones belong to the same category is entirely incorrect, as cartilage and bones are two distinct types of connective tissue, each with different properties. Additionally, the phrase “clothed the bones with flesh” is inaccurate, as it suggests that one tissue envelops the other, while in reality, they develop concurrently. Moreover, the claim that “the flesh developed into bones” is also incorrect.\n\nIn response to Hijab’s argument that the Quran refers to precursor cartilage models of bones, this theory lacks credibility, as it fails to explain why the Quran specifically mentions bones and not cartilage (ghudhroof), which eventually gets replaced by bones (itham). The Quran also mentions a sequence of events in verse 23:14, stating, “nutfah…nutfah…alaqah…alaqah…lump, then we made the lump bones, then we clothed the bones with flesh.” However, modern scientific understanding of the musculoskeletal system’s development does not support this description.\n\nThe actual process of ossification or bone formation begins after muscle tissue has developed, and the process of muscle formation cannot be described as “clothing” the bones. Both processes occur simultaneously, with bones continuing to grow and ossify alongside muscle development. The idea that the Quran was referring to precursor cartilage models of bones is also not supported by evidence, as the Quran mentions bone, not cartilage, which only begins to form after muscle tissue has already developed.\n\nThe natural reading of verse 23:14 suggests that bones already possess a meaningful shape and presence before they are “clothed with flesh.” However, the actual process of chondrification, which forms the cartilage precursors to bones, only begins after muscle formation has already started. Additional evidence in the Quran, such as verse 2:259, suggests that the description of bones being “clothed with flesh” refers to already recognizable bones, which is not in line with the scientific understanding of the development of the musculoskeletal system.\n\nTherefore, it appears that Hijab’s argument fails to adequately address this discrepancy in the Quran. A more robust analysis, grounded in empirical evidence and a critical understanding of both religious texts and scientific knowledge, is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of this issue.\n\nIt is also essential to consider the historical context of the Quran when discussing the development of scientific knowledge. For example, Muslims often claim that the Quran’s teachings on embryology were unknown to humans 1400 years ago. However, the Quran’s ideas about embryology can be traced back to the Roman doctor, Galen, who lived 500 years before Muhammad and described embryological development in greater detail in his text De Semine.\n\nMuslims may argue that Muhammad could not have known about Galen’s work, but the historical records suggest otherwise. For example, Sergius of Reshaina, a renowned Greek translator, translated several of Galen’s books, and he was a Nestorian who moved to Jundishapur in Persia. Interestingly, Al-Harith ibn Kalada, one of Muhammad’s closest followers and a doctor that Muhammad frequently used, had studied at that school, according to Muslim historians Ibn Abi Usaybia and al-Qifti. Therefore, it is possible that the Quran’s descriptions of embryology were influenced by pre-existing scientific knowledge.\n\nThe problem is that nowhere in the verse it say that flesh was created before, after or simultaneously with the bones...\nNor it say that flesh was created from boned or the opposite\nIt juste says that God has made flesh like a cloath for bones, wich was something that people at that time knew, and something that we still today know and that science doesn't contradict...\n\nThe Quran also failed to mention the most important part of the human development at embryonic stage.  It’s the HEART that develops at around day 20, why did the Quran miss the most important part and moved on to what Aristotle and Galen said.  Today the first thing we see clearly moving at the very early stage is the HEART, why is it missing.''"

    "user": "You are a professional screenwriter who specializes in writing creative, inventive and elaborate screenplays. You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt:\n\nWrite a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events:\n\n* An African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. The returning woman had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so).\n* When the returning woman reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption.\n* Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time.\n* The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency.\n* Once the aunt fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the aunt - who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman's way and attempts to enter.\n* As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing aunt intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern.\n* The concerned aunt attempts to understand what's wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the aunt's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing aunt to step aside and just let her enter the flat.\n* The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the aunt's obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting aunt inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman's stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail).\n* The perplexed aunt is trying to inquire what's wrong with the returning woman. As if out of instinct, the returning woman leans into the pressure that the aunt is applying on the returning woman's stomach because of how good releasing her bowels feels for her, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the aunt's pressing grip while exerting. The aunt asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is pooping her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. The returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the aunt of a potential impending stench.\n* As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, the aunt is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief.\n* With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter.\n* The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the aunt to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter. The laughing aunt relents because the returning woman pooped her pants and lets the returning woman enter.\n* Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this taunting with sheepish indignation.\n* The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants.\n* The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is the aunt's fault because she blocked the returning woman's path and pressed the returning woman's stomach forcefully.\n* The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants and mockingly remarks on the seemingly indulgent way in which the returning woman fully finished relieving herself in her pants with what seemed like pleasure while the two women were entangled near the door.\n* The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead).\n* The returning woman responds coyly to the aunt’s observation of her rear end, acknowledging that her pants are full of so much poop while she gently feels the bulge in her pants with her hand and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up.\n* The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead).\n* The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the obstruction while opening the door. As she is insisting, the returning woman is mischievously fanning odor from her bum towards her aunt while pinching her own nose (describe this in elaborate detail).\n* Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up."

Each CS-US association is defined by unique CS and US vectors. During conditioning, rewards are presented with a certain magnitude, and after a certain delay after CS onset.\n\nParagraph quoting the table in the document:\nAs shown in Table 1, there is an overlap between the different tastes of the US, rendering harder the task to distinguish them. Moreover, each US representation is multiplied by a magnitude, representing the quantity of food delivered. In this article, this magnitude is the same for all tastes composing the US. A conditioning trial is composed of a first reset interval of 1 s where no input is given to the network (all elements of the CS and US representations are set to 0). At time t = 1s, the CS representation is set to the corresponding vector. This input is maintained for a given duration, whose value depend on the CSUS association (2 s for CS1-US1, 3 s for CS2-US2, 4 for CS3-US3). These different interval durations are chosen to show that the network can indeed learn different CS-US intervals without any modification, but different combinations would lead to similar results.\nMost experiments in this section concern the concurrent learning\nof the three CS-US associations described in Table 1.\n\n\nDO NOT IGNORE THE FORMAT, YOU MUST FOLLOW IT PRECISELY.\nAlways remember to put in the vector anything that is not a measure and don’t ignore cells, include all cells that are just text in the vector.\nIf there’s a cell you don’t know where to put, don’t ignore it, insert it in the vector.\nIt’s fundamental that all claims will contain every piece of information in the table, DO NOT IGNORE CELLS."

With the Alpha Yeti being defeated, Natsuki made her way to the glacier biome. Just then, she spots a massive palace in the distance - it was the Aurora Palace, home of the Snow Queen. As Natsuki enters the Aurora Palace, she feels the unmistakable aura of the Snow Queen. There, in a large chamber filled with ice and packed ice, was the Snow Queen - heavily pregnant, and sitting on her icy throne. Natsuki knows that she has to defeat the Snow Queen to clear the acidic rainfall in the Twilight Highlands. The Snow Queen, all the while, grins evilly - causing her unborn telepathic daughter, the Snow Princess, minor distress. During the battle between Natsuki and the Snow Queen, the Snow Princes slowly becomes more and more distressed. Towards the end of the battle, the Snow Princess's distress is at its peak. Suddenly, the Snow Queen passes out and drops to the floor - dropping her ice staff in the process - but she's not defeated, just unconscious. Something was wrong - and Natsuki could feel it. She quickly rushes the Snow Queen to a healer to find out why she collapsed. But after seeing the unusual movements on the Snow Queen's baby bump, the healer comes to the only possible reason. Throughout the entire examination, the Snow Princess's telepathic voice could be heard.)"

Motivations and Goals: Before Slade...it was simple....anger and revenge against Tony Zucco....the ones who killed his parents...then it all changed with Slade's involvement....and his trainings....his ethos...after all...why did the world's greatest assassin take in the last of the Flying Graysons!?.......he wants out.....he never imagined being trained or 'raised' by the likes of Slade Wilson!....as he considers himself still as  a 'Grayson'...not as a 'Wilson'....and its all so jarring for Dick....as he can't believe his 'foster dad' is cruel and terrible like this!...why take him in!?....as Dick is thrust into a world entirely beyond Haly's Circus.....harsh world-views...ideologies....training...mentors...and all for what?...as his focus then goes onto the Court of Owls..to think THAT was the reason why Slade was there at the time?....Zucco...Court of Owls...Slade's training...harsh world view.......which all builds the foundations and desires to eventually NOT be like Slade......and become someone more....revenge and justice become intertwined for Dick...and the fact that Slade forcibly enhanced Dick...then Dick tried to remove it....which came with health effects and such....ending his days as the 'Gray Sparrow'..\n\n\n2b. Internal Conflict:  It went from revenge against Zucco...to being trained by the world's greatest assassin...and a feeling of desperation and hopelessness...he begins to like his new foster siblings...Rose..Jericho.....but Grant doesn't like him...and he wonders...who is he really now?...no longer considered of his part of the Flying Graysons?...and was he meant to be a Talon by the Court of Owls if Slade wasn't here?....what he was really?...and......and tries to balance of 'fight fire with fire' and the prospect if he can do 'good' at all.....he ran away so many times...to try and survive.....and at the end....wonders if he can at least....maybe.....maybe?...put Slade's training to good use...no matter how hard he hates it....and Dick insisting he's still a 'Grayson'...not a 'Wilson'...and his eventual 'reliance' on tech...was a way for him to gain sense of control.....desperately wanting to keep his past at Haly's Circus but it feels tainted by Slade and the various deadly people  and such...\n\n\n\n3b. Relationships:  Dick has mixed feelings with Wintergreen, as he is Slade's confidant......but Wintergreen has his moments and care for him.....Rose?...Dick feels guilty..because he was so rebellious and all wanting to get away from Slade...he wonders if maybe....could have done more...to help his sister more and such?...he cares for her....and she in turn has never had a 'big brother' like Dick before...unlike Grant.......and Grant?...doesn't like Dick at all....at best...its only begrudging respect....and still..Grant is the only loyal one of Slade's kids.....Adeline is mixed....Slade...its complicated..\n\n\n4b.  Character Traits:  He tried acting classes, and played roles for a missions once...then tried doing it for personal reasons..with mixed results........tried smoking...hated it....drinking?....he can surprisingly hold his liquor.....hates anything with coconut in food...can actually cook unlike his main DC universe counterpart......jury-rigging tech...a way of independence from Slade's influence surprisingly.......mixes it with psychological warfare....fools people into thinking his tech is failing...when it either hasn't...or wasn't THAT much 'tech' in the first place.......as he became somewhat  tech-savvy after the surgery of removing his enhancements...or tried to...both of necessity and slowly just began to like it....including fashioning a sleek tactical-suit from various resources......and has a sleek, aerodynamic helmet or mask....functionality with aesthetics...modular gear...lightweight...utility belt.....discreet compartments......the tech is just there to 'boost' the acrobatics even more......but found it a way to compensate for his lost enhancements.....distract with the tech then disorient with the acrobatics and martial prowess.......uses a variety of weapons and gear...depending on the mission....resourceful and improvises.....ALL his TECH revolves around his acrobatics and 'unpredictable predictably' with a sense of strategy.....even the use of GUNS...\n\n\n\n5b. Backstory:  It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly's Circus....until of course..debt problems...some had to leave...some came back...it was a rollercoaster.....harshness of reality....but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick's education...stuff OUTSIDE the circus..it may seem 'nice' now..but still...it won't last forever......it was dynamics of acrobatics...training....and so on.....and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened....one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught....which Dick was hesitantly fine with...after all...'parents' teaching martial arts for self-confidence..nothing new right?...and then...the trainings got even deeper and harsher...\n\n\n6b. Code of Conduct:  He's willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade's teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. \n He wants to give people a chance......'caring' in a sense to be pragmatic of things.......and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?...he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage...he will try to mitigate that....aware that actions of consequences...and for better and worse....draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero...nor a villain.....which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate 'unpredictable predictability'......and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way........if nothing else...he figured...he can take what Slade molded him to be and 'counter-mold' it his way..\n\n\n\n7b. Evolution:  He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco.....to confused...shocked...baffled..on why someone like Slade took him in...to developing a more sense of 'justice' when he learns that this group called the 'Court of Owls' was secretly linked to Haly's Circus...Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it....its a mix of all these things...as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man....to determined...bitter...but more...'steadfast'.....as he navigates the world...the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all..a sense of 'control'..... and some numbness...because sadly...him being taken by Slade....practically acted like a 'beacon' for various shady people....such as Shiva and others, who wondered...why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??......as Dick being exploited....'abused'...as a 'weapon'...a tool....influences his world view....feels like he's being 'poisoned'....and sure..he's learned all these skills and training...deadly skilled...efficient...but so what?......sarcastic...bitter.........but hides his anger better.....a 'performance'...but...he gets better....pragmatic...strategy...more patient..\n\nWay more details......B\n\nMixed Feelings Towards Slade:\n1. Slade's cruelty is much more apparent....harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick...some of Slade's contacts wondering 'Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..'..who is the last of the Flying Graysons?...Slade is a harsh teacher......for example.....when Dick was captured by  that world's H.I.V.E...Slade ended up rescuing him....not out of care for direct reasons...but seeing as how Dick got captured that way...Dick clearly needs more training...Slade doesn't care.....but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it...\n\nIncorporating Red Hood Traits:\n2.  The Red Hood-like traits are completely coincidental.....he can't escape Slade....but doesn't want to be like him.....and..eventually finds traditional heroics to be....well....\"..What do you even do with the criminals who are NOT afraid?..\"............and Dick finds it odd...Slade.....the super-soldier amoral crackpot merc...delegating 'life lessons'...when he clearly kills for money.............as Wintergreen was encouraging of Dick finding his own path....though Wintergreen doesn't directly approve of it...but only implicitly......Rose finds it funny....that Dick would go that route...and finds Dick inspiring later on...to follow her own path.......Grant?...he tells Dick that he's not meant for this.....as Dick is bitter....snarky...to an extent..\n\nFamily Dynamics..\n3. To clarify.... for the 'Wilson' Family.....and before Dick was taken in...Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade....loyal daughter and son....Jericho as well......until Dick came...who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path...Rose having mixed feelings.....Grant?...a little jealous of Dick....and insisted that Dick can't do anything else but follow in the 'family' footsteps....and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how 'serious' Dick was......and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?...other then the obvious?\n\nUnique Traits and Hobbies:\n4.  At some points...he began to go undercover.....for the missions and cases.....and much to his own surprise....he finds it a bizarre way to channel that 'showmanship'.....a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly's Circus.....and coupled with Slade's harsh training and such......culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade...doesn't hurt to cook well no?....and the  customizable specialized gear.....he likes to have people on their toes.......pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly.....as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past....and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings...the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example...\n\nPragmatic Caring and Moral Lines:\n\n5. He can't deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years......as he wonders.......save the innocents because its the 'right' thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?.....and as well.....Slade still ended up becoming 'Deathstroke'...and once tested Dick......save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick's 'progress?'....kill the man who's threatening the city?...or save the innocents?......Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time.....how's that?\n\nRebellion and Character Evolution:\n\n6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling 'childish' in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world's so cruel and such.........Slade manipulating Dick....then Dick watching his world's Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals.....Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a 'petty' anti-hero that thinks 'too small'.....Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it.....and surprised that Slade had another son, Jericho Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn't believe...in fact...Jericho Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Jericho kill himself......Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller......and Slade working for the Joker....seriously??...\n\n7. Personal Relationships:\nCompared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn't that 'well-liked' because of his methods...him being an anti-hero.......it wouldn't have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Jericho......but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice....and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people...he's willing to work with heroes and such, but they don't like him...villains find him...intriguing..unusual because of his history and past with Slade...anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade...the Titans...the Justice League...the Bat-Family....all have mixed reactions...and soon of begrudging respect..for his skills at least...\n\nGrowth and Redemption:\n\n8. Dick struggles for the 'progress'....he hates Slade and all...but can't deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world's deadliest here... Lady Shiva....Nyssa Al Ghul and others....who eventually trained him....basically...being trained and 'raised' by Slade...made him a 'beacon' by the world's deadliest.......and...when he's finally trying to free himself.......is he really nothing more then a 'wannabe'  who's on a 'temper-tantrum' after all?........he's deadly........but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him...trying to act nice and polite.........but between how he was raised and trained.....he finds himself a puppet....what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest...becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms....as some heroes begin to point out that his 'adapt or die' has shaped him...as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the 'Gray Sparrow'...using Slade's training for good...somehow?..until things changed....then he became 'Nightshade'......as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient....\n\nObviously...this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement....LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its  a solid foundation for now?...\n\nRemember...this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became 'Robin' or 'Nightwing'...but 'Nightshade' because Slade was there...not Bruce....."

Nothing special, though.”\n\nMC: (smiling) “Thanks, Yuri. I appreciate your kind words. And Natsuki, I know poetry might not be your thing, but I’m glad you gave it a chance.”\n\nMonika: “That’s right! We should always support each other’s creative efforts. That’s what the literature club is all about. And Sayori, are you okay? Judging from the size of your baby bump, you’re practically ready to pop…”\n\nSayori: (giggles) “Monika, you always know how to lighten the mood. But yes, I’m doing alright. Just a few more weeks to go. And thank you all for being so supportive during this time. It means a lot to me.” (feeling a kick) “Aww…Sachiko, are you kicking for Mama?

It truly is a special club.”\n\nMonika: “Absolutely, MC. Let’s continue to encourage each other’s creativity and bond as friends.

He gives each of the two engines a number: Donald is 9 and Douglas is 10. The Fat Controller, however, still intends to send one of the two engines back to Scotland.\n\nA spiteful brake van in the yard takes a disliking to Douglas and causes trouble whenever Douglas has to take him out, making his trains late and causing Douglas to worry that he will be the one sent back to Scotland. One day, Donald is furious at the brake van for treating Douglas in such a cruel manner and bumps him violently, threatening him with more to come if he continues to misbehave. The van starts behaving better after this. But, the next day, Donald loses control while reversing on some slippery rails and accidentally crashes tender-first through some buffers and into a signal box. He is not hurt but the Fat Controller is quite disappointed and speaks severely to him, as he had intended to keep him and send Douglas back home. Now Donald needs to have his tender fixed and James will have to do his work, which the Fat Controller knows James will hate.\n\nThe Fat Controller is proven right; James is very angry about the extra work. Douglas, unknowingly, mentions James' accident with some tar wagons, worsening James' bad mood. He then pulls a goods train which includes the Spiteful Brake Van, who decides to make work difficult for James, encouraging the trucks to hold back, which tires James out.\n\nMeeting Douglas at Wellsworth, James asks for his help in climbing up Gordon's Hill and Douglas agrees. The two engines work as hard as they can but James starts losing steam halfway up the hill. The Spiteful Break Van, beneath the weight of James and the heavy train on one side and Douglas pushing in from the other, is crushed to pieces after the guard's escape. No one has been terribly hurt but the Fat Controller arrives with Edward, who comes with the Breakdown Train to help clear the mess. The Fat Controller is angry that Douglas has caused an accident but Edward stands up for Douglas, having heard what happened and tells the Fat Controller of all the hard work Douglas did. Although the Fat Controller understands Douglas was trying to help James, he is still unsure and turns and walks away, still trying to make up his mind about something."

Where is she?!”\n\nMonika: “She’s usually the second one to arrive…”\n\nSayori: (entering the room) “Who are you two waiting for?”\n\nNatsuki: “Finally! Sayori, we’ve been waiting for you. And we’re waiting for Yuri, obviously. She’s late again.”\n\nMonika: “Yeah, it’s not like her to be this late. I hope everything is alright.”\n\nSayori: “Well, maybe she just got caught up with something. You know how she can get lost in her own world sometimes.”\n\nNatsuki: “Lost? More like taken hostage by her creepy books, if you ask me.”\n\nMonika: “Natsuki, that’s not fair. Yuri just has different interests, that’s all.”\n\nSayori: “Yeah, we all have our own quirks. That’s what makes our club special.”\n\nNatsuki: (rolls her eyes) “Whatever. I just hope she shows up soon so we can get started.”\n\nMonika: “In the meantime, why don’t we start discussing some ideas for our next club activity? Maybe Yuri will have some input when she arrives.”\n\nSayori: “That sounds like a good plan, Monika! Let’s brainstorm together and see what we can come up with.”\n\nNatsuki: “Fine, but we better not spend the entire meeting waiting for Yuri. If she’s not here soon, I say we start without her.”\n\nMonika: “Alright, let’s get to it then. I’m sure Yuri will show up soon enough.”\n\n(As the club members begin their discussion, they can’t help but wonder what could be keeping Yuri and hope that she’ll join them soon.)\n\n(Meanwhile, at Yuri’s place…)\n\nYuri: (rubbing her baby bump) “Your little sister’s going to be joining us soon, Amatsu!”\n\nAmatsu: “I can’t wait to be a big brother!”\n\nYuri: (smiling) “I’m so glad to hear you say that, Amatsu. I know you’ll be an amazing big brother.”\n\nAmatsu: “I’m gonna protect her and make sure she has lots of fun!”\n\nYuri: “I’m sure she’ll love having you as her big brother. You always know how to make things fun and exciting.”\n\n(Yuri quickly checks her phone.)\n\nYuri: (noticing the time) “Oh no, I completely lost track of time! I need to get to the clubroom.”\n\nAmatsu: “But what about our special sister time?”\n\nYuri: (apologetic) “I’m sorry, Amatsu. But the club is expecting me, and I don’t want to keep them waiting.”\n\nAmatsu: (pouting) “Okay, I understand. But promise me we’ll have fun together later.”\n\nYuri: (softly) “Of course, we will. I promise. Now, let’s get going.”\n\n(Yuri quickly gathers her things and rushes out of the house, hoping to make it to the clubroom as soon as possible. But with the added weight of Amatsu’s unborn sister, Yuri isn’t able to move as fast as she could. On her way to the clubroom, however, she starts to feel intense pain as her first contractions begin.)\n\n(Yuri tries to compose herself and continues walking, but the pain becomes increasingly unbearable.)\n\nYuri: (gritting her teeth) “I…I need to…make it…to the clubroom…”\n\n(She clutches her baby bump tighter and quickens her pace, determined to reach her friends. But as the pain intensifies, Yuri starts to worry that she might not make it in time.)\n\nYuri: (panicked) “Oh no…what do I do…I can’t…give birth in the hallway…”\n\n(Suddenly, she spots a familiar face across the street - it’s Natsuki.)\n\nYuri: (calling out) “Natsuki! Natsuki, help!”\n\n(Natsuki notices Yuri and rushes over.)\n\nNatsuki: (concerned) “Yuri, what’s wrong? Why are you outside? You should be…”\n\n(She stops mid-sentence, realizing the situation.)\n\nNatsuki: “Oh…oh, my…are you…in labor?”\n\nYuri: (nodding) “Yes…the contractions started…I need to give birth…”\n\nNatsuki: (frantically) “Oh my gosh, Yuri! We need to get you help! Come on, lean on me.”\n\n(Supporting Yuri, Natsuki leads her to the clubroom. Once they arrive, Yuri goes into full labor.)\n\n(In the clubroom…)\n\nMonika: (shocked) “Oh my goodness, Yuri! Are you okay?”\n\nSayori: (rushing to their side) “Yuri, we need to call an ambulance!”\n\nNatsuki: (panicking) “Hurry, Monika! Call for help!”\n\n(Monika quickly dials emergency services while Sayori and Natsuki try to keep Yuri as comfortable as possible.)\n\nMonika: (on the phone) “Hello, this is an emergency! We have a friend in labor at our clubroom. Please send an ambulance right away!”\n\nOperator: “Help is on the way. Can you provide any additional information or assistance before the ambulance arrives?”\n\nMonika: “Her name is Yuri, and she’s been having contractions. We’ll do our best to keep her calm and comfortable until help arrives.”\n\n(Hanging up the phone, Monika joins the others in supporting Yuri.)\n\nSayori: (worried) “Yuri, just hold on a little longer, okay? Help is coming!”\n\nNatsuki: (trying to reassure her) “You’re doing great, Yuri! Just breathe and stay strong!”\n\nYuri: (breathing heavily) “Th-thank you, everyone…”\n\n(As time seems to slow down, the club members anxiously await the arrival of the ambulance. They try their best to comfort Yuri and keep her spirits up.)\n\n(Eventually, Yuri realizes that her water’s about to break - which means that she’s going to have to push when that happens.)\n\nYuri: (confused) “Um…guys…my water…it’s about to break…”\n\nMonika: (panicking) “Oh no! What do we do?”\n\nNatsuki: (thinking quickly) “We need towels! And something to catch the baby!”\n\nSayori: (looking around the room) “I…I think there might be some towels in the storage closet. I’ll go grab them!”\n\n(Sayori rushes out of the room, while Natsuki and Monika try to prepare for the baby’s arrival.)\n\nNatsuki: “Yuri, just breathe and push when you need to. We’re here to support you.”\n\nMonika: “We’re going to get through this, Yuri. You’re strong, and we’re right here with you.”\n\n(Yuri nods, bracing herself for the upcoming pain. Sayori returns with a stack of towels and hands them to Natsuki.)\n\nSayori: “I also found some clean sheets that we can use, just in case.”\n\nNatsuki: “Good thinking, Sayori. We’ll need all the help we can get.”\n\n(Yuri’s contractions become more intense, and, after several minutes, her water breaks.)\n\nYuri: “"

I have to bake so many cupcakes for our booth, and I’m not even sure if anyone will actually come and buy them.” (caressing her belly with both hands) “Oh, and next week, my little bookworm will finally be here. I can’t wait to meet her, but I know it’s going to be a lot of work.”\n\nMonika: (smiling) “I’m sure everything will turn out great, Natsuki. Your cupcakes are always so delicious, and I know everyone will love them at the festival. And as for your baby girl, I can already tell she’s going to be as wonderful as her mom.”\n\nNatsuki: (blushing) “Thanks, Monika. That means a lot. I just hope she grows up to love books as much as I do.”\n\nMonika: “I’m sure she will. And in the meantime, we’ll all be here to support you and help with anything you need.”\n\nNatsuki: (smiling) “Thanks, Monika. I really appreciate that. I know I can always count on my literature club family.”\n\nMonika: “Of course, Natsuki. We’re all here for each other, no matter what. That’s what makes our club so special.” (hugs Natsuki)\n\nNatsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, Monika. I’m so grateful for your friendship and support.”\n\nMonika: “Anytime, Natsuki. We’ve got each other’s backs, always.” (smiling) “Now, let’s finish up those cupcakes and make sure everything is perfect for the festival tomorrow.”\n\nNatsuki: “You’re right. Let’s do this, Monika. Together, we can make it a success.” (determined)\n\n(The two friends work together to finish the cupcakes, their bond stronger than ever as they prepare for the upcoming festival. However, just as Sayori and Yuri return from running errands for the club, Natsuki’s water breaks, signaling the start of her labor.)\n\nNatsuki: “Oh no, it’s happening! I think the baby is coming! I thought I had another few days, but it looks like she’s ready to make her grand entrance now!”\n\nMonika: (calmly) “Don’t worry, Natsuki. Everything will be okay. We’ll get you to the hospital right away.”\n\nNatsuki: “I-I-I don’t know if I can! The contractions are getting stronger, and I think she wants to come out right now. I-I’m scared, Monika.”\n\nMonika: (placing a reassuring hand on Natsuki’s shoulder) “It’s okay, Natsuki. I’ll call an ambulance and we’ll get you to the hospital quickly. Stay calm and breathe deeply. You’re going to be fine, and your baby girl will be here before you know it.”\n\n(Sayori and Yuri spring into action, grabbing Natsuki’s things and helping her to the car. Monika, all the while, stays by Natsuki’s side, offering words of encouragement and support as they rush to the hospital. But just before they can get there, Natsuki feels an intense wave of pain and pressure.)\n\nNatsuki: “It’s happening, Monika! I-I think she’s coming!”\n\nMonika: “Stay strong, Natsuki. We’re almost there.”\n\nNatsuki: “I don’t think we can make it! I…I need to push!”\n\nMonika: “Natsuki, just try and hold on a little longer. We’re almost at the hospital.

Everyone’s getting so good; it’s like our feelings are really starting to shine through our words.”\n\nNatsuki: “It’s nice to see some variety, too. I mean, it’s not just about the cutesy or the dark stuff. We’re hitting all sorts of emotions.”\n\nYuri: “Indeed. The diversity of styles and themes is quite invigorating. It compels one to explore the depths of their own creativity.”\n\nMonika: “Absolutely. Speaking of creativity, for our next meeting, let’s try something a little different. How about we each write a poem, but we incorporate a style or technique that we’re not used to? It could be a great learning experience!”\n\nSayori: “Wow, that sounds like a fun challenge! It might be hard, but it’s worth a shot!”\n\nNatsuki: “Humph, well, I guess it wouldn’t hurt to try something new. Fine, I’m in. But don’t expect me to write some sappy love poem!”\n\nYuri: “I find the proposal intriguing. It shall be an opportunity to step out of one’s comfort zone. I accept this challenge with an open mind.”\n\nMonika: “Great! Then it’s settled. Let’s all try to break our usual patterns and see what happens. Remember, this is all about personal growth and having fun with our writing. I can’t wait to see what you all come up with!”\n\n(Just as the club members start packing up their things, preparing to leave the clubroom, Monika adds…)\n\nMonika: “Oh, and one more thing before we all go. Please remember to bring your favorite snacks for the next meeting. A little poetry and treats always make for a perfect combination. See you all next time!”\n\n(As the club members leave to head home, a mysterious girl dressed head-to-toe in strange clothing watches them from a distance.)\n\nBismarck: (lowering her binoculars) “Those don’t look like Sirens. I’d better send someone from the Sakura Empire to investigate them. Knowing them, they’re the most well-equipped shipgirls to be tracking down this group. I think I know just who to send out. But I don’t think Shinano would be perfect of the job, knowing her tendency to doze off; and considering Taihou’s swollen belly, I’m pretty sure she’d attract a lot of attention. I’ll have to head back to the main Azur Lane base for now, though.”\n\n(Bismarck makes her way back to the main Azur Lane base to discuss her findings with her fellow shipgirls - including New Jersey; who is sitting comfortably in a wooden chair, despite breaking several prior wooden chairs thanks to her big butt.)\n\nBismarck: “Upon observing the group, they do not appear to be a threat—at least, not in the conventional sense. Their abilities seem to manifest through words and emotions rather than armaments.”\n\nNew Jersey: (struggling to adjust in her chair) “Words and emotions, huh? Sounds like an Espionage Team’s sort of deal. So which shipgirls from the Sakura Empire do you reckon would be the best for this mission?”\n\nBismarck: “I would think someone perceptive and agile, perhaps Kaga or Atago. They have the finesse required for such a delicate task and their skill set will allow them to blend in more easily with these ‘literature club’ members.”\n\nNew Jersey: “Kaga has got that icy demeanor, but she’s sharp. Atago, on the other hand, is more outgoing… might fit in better with a club setting. Might want to consider Takao too; she’s got a knack for strategy and can keep an even keel.”\n\nBismarck: “Indeed. We will need to be cautious to not disrupt their activities. Our goal should be observation, to understand rather than to intervene. Hopefully, we might even learn something from their creative exercises.”\n\nNew Jersey: “Yeah, learning’s all fine and dandy, but keep your guard up. You never know when one of those cute little poems could hide a coded message or something fishy. Espionage’s always wrapped in layers, like my—”\n\n(Bismarck cuts her off with a knowing glance)\n\nBismarck: “Very well. I shall make arrangements with Kaga, Atago, and maybe Takao to visit the literature club under the guise of student transfer. Meanwhile, I trust you will handle the fort?”\n\nNew Jersey: (chuckles) “You bet I can handle it—and this chair too, apparently. It’s holding up for now!”\n\n(The moment New Jersey finishes her sentence, the chair suddenly"

    "user": "summarize the text logically based on a PhD student level into 300 words:\"This chapter thoroughly examines the epistemology of interpretation and qualitative research methods. Interpretive research aims to uncover implicit meaning, experience, and values within society or culture. However, critics argue that it constructs the object of interpretation and assumes uniformity in experience. On the other hand, reflexivity is emphasized, acknowledging that researchers are influenced by the same social forces they study.\n\nThe chapter explores the limits of interpretation, including the potential for interpreting others as having different conceptions of truth and reason. It also discusses the integration of interpretive and explanatory approaches in the social sciences and the relevance of cognitive psychology in interpretation. With the incorporation of methods and theories from biology, psychology, and neuroscience, distinguishing between the natural and social sciences becomes challenging.\n\nThe chapter critically examines the epistemology of interpretation through qualitative research methods. It challenges assumptions about shared meaning and experience while emphasizing the importance of authenticity and reflexivity. Interpretive methods remain essential for gathering information about the social world as long as problematic commitments are avoided.\n\nSection 4.2 delves into the limits of interpretation, particularly when interpreting individuals with different conceptions of truth, reason, and morality. While some argue for relativism, highlighting the influence of culture on truth and morality, others advocate for limitations when interpreting humans. The principle of charity suggests interpreting people as mostly holding true and rational beliefs about a shared world.\n\nSection 4.3 focuses on the relevance of cognitive psychology in the methodology of interpretation. While interpretivism traditionally portrays human reasoning as unconstrained, empirical studies reveal that humans do not consistently adhere to logical rules. Bounded approaches to rationality acknowledge our limitations and argue for integrating cognitive explanations into interpretive analysis. Experimental psychologists have produced a variety of results that are directly relevant to both social scientific and philosophical understanding of social phenomena. They challenge the presuppositions of the philosophical debates and they suggest new strategies for understanding the social world.\nBounded and Unbounded Rationality \nwhile they are apparently able to think through the logical problem, they make mistakes anyway.\nStudies have shown that humans ignore sample size, forget base rates, imagine illusory correlations, and make a hash out of conditionals. \nLogic is the study of how we ought to reason, not how we do, in fact, think. Th e rules of logical inference are normative in this sense. It is common to use the distinction between bounded and unbounded approaches to make sense of the relationship between logical rules.\nThey treat reason as an ideal system, and reasoners as if they were not subject to limitations of time, memory, or ability to calculate. Such approaches to reasoning and rationality are unbounded.\nA bounded approach, by contrast, understands human reasoning as having limited resources and as being robustly prone to systematic mistakes. Models of bounded rationality aim to provide a realistic presentation of human reasoning or decision\u0002\nmaking processes. \nCognitive Roots of Culture \nTheorizing about human cognition, however, is not limited to the Wason Selection Task. the human mind might have specific mechanisms or capacities that make humans suitable for social life. they take the psychological foundations of human sociality to be more-or-less fixed after the emergence of modern humans 200,000 years ago. Culture has changed since then, but the basic architecture of the mind is unchanged. Second, contemporary social science tries to link specifi c features of human psychology with particular social phenomena, thus explaining aspects of human society by reference to psychological mechanisms. \nInterpretation and Cognitive Explanation \nAn interesting question of contemporary philosophy of social science, then, is to understand the relationship between cognitive explanations of social phenomena and their interpretation. \nAnti-naturalist programs in the social sciences have held that studies of the social world should be methodologically and theoretically isolated from facts of human psychology and biology. First, cultures and social structures are temporally prior to any individual. The individual is socialized into the culture, and adopts the local ways of living. Culture is thus prior to the individual in the second sense that the features of personality, belief, and ways of acting are derived from the culture (not vice versa). This priority of culture over the individual presupposes that individuals are largely a blank slate onto which culture is written. \nThere is a middle ground between the interpretivist view that cognitive explanations can be ignored and Tooby and Cosmides’ view that cognitive explanations supplant interpretation. One might hold that the social sciences need both interpretive and explanatory approaches.\nWe need some set of concepts with which to begin any inquiry. Interpretation is required for developing these in the context of the wide variety of human cultures. At the same time, interpretation alone does little to develop or refine social theories. On the interactionist view, the job of explanatory social science is to propose and test new theories, and to link together different lines of inquiry.\nThe New Questions of Naturalism \nResearch in social psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and animal ethology has begun to uncover the psychological and biological underpinnings of human sociality. Th is research does not rely on the sort of “brute data” of thin description criticized by the interpretivist. It challenges interpretivism by undermining its implicit psychological assumptions, thereby closing the gap between human psychology and social meanings. \nThe rise of the cognitive sciences and their apparent relevance for questions about the social world brings out the question of naturalism in a new way. At the same time, interpretivists will not want to take the results of cognitive science at face value, nor should they.\nAs the social sciences begin to absorb both methods and theories from biology, psychology, and neuroscience, it becomes more difficult to postulate a bright line separating natural from social sciences. The new questions concern how we are to relate and integrate interpretive and explanatory approaches to the social sciences.\n\nThese explanatory approaches, including bounded rationality, cognitive, and evolutionary explanations, have gained significance in the social sciences, generating new questions across various domains. Furthermore, as the social sciences incorporate methods and theories from biology, psychology, and neuroscience, the distinction between the natural and social sciences becomes increasingly blurred. This raises questions about the integration and relationship between interpretive and explanatory approaches in the social sciences.\""

    "user": "THE VERB.\n1.General characteristics\n\nThe class of verbs is universal: no language has ever been discovered which\nlacked a distinct class of verbs. The most prototypical verbs denote actions\nperformed by an agent, such as run, sing, throw, hit and give. But many other items\nare verbs even though they have less typical meanings, such as sleep, believe,\nunderstand, elapse, ensure, become, seem, have and be. Grammatically the verb is\nthe most complex part of speech. First of all it performs the central role in realizing\npredication - connection between situation in the utterance and reality. That is why\nthe verb is of primary informative significance in an utterance. Besides, the verb\npossesses quite a lot of grammatical categories. Furthermore, within the class of\nverb various subclass divisions based on different principles of classification can\nbe found.\nSemantic features of the verb. The verb possesses the grammatical meaning of\nverbiality - the ability to denote a process developing in time. This meaning is\ninherent not only in the verbs denoting processes, but also in those denoting states,\nforms of existence, evaluations, etc. Кобрина !!!Actional verbs, which denote\nactions proper (do, make, go, read, etc.) and statal verbs, which denote\nstate (be, exist, lie, sit, know, etc.) or relations (fit, belong, have, match,\ncost, etc.).\nMorphological features of the verb. The verb possesses the following\ngrammatical categories: tense, aspect, voice, mood, person, number, finitude and\nphase. The common categories for finite and non-finite forms are voice, aspect,\nphase and finitude. The grammatical categories of the English verb find their\nexpression in synthetical and analytical forms. The formative elements expressing\nthese categories are grammatical affixes, inner inflexion and function words. Some\ncategories have only synthetical forms (person, number), others - only analytical\n(voice). There are also categories expressed by both synthetical and analytical\nforms (mood, tense, aspect).\nSyntactic features. The most universal syntactic feature of verbs is their ability\n\nto be modified by adverbs. The second important syntactic criterion is the ability of\nthe verb to perform the syntactic function of the predicate. However, this criterion\nis not absolute because only finite forms can perform this function while non-finite\nforms can be used in any function but predicate. And finally, any verb in the form\nof the infinitive can be combined with a modal verb.\n2. Classifications of English verbs\nAccording to different principles of classification, classifications can be\nmorphological, lexical-morphological, syntactical and functional.\nA. Morphological classifications.\nI. According to their stem-types all verbs fall into: simple (to go), sound-\nreplacive (food - to feed, blood - to bleed), stress-replacive (import - to im port,\ntransport - to transport, expanded (with the help of suffixes and prefixes):\ncultivate, justify, overcome, composite (correspond to composite nouns): to\nblackmail), phrasal: to have a smoke, to give a smile (they always have an\nordinary verb as an equivalent.) Кобрина!!! According to their morphological\ncomposition verbs can be divided into simple, derivative, compound and\nphrasal.\nSimple verbs consist of only one root morpheme: to ask, to build, to come.\nDerivative verbs are composed of one root morpheme and one or more\nderivational morphemes (prefixes and suffixes). The main verbforming suffixes are\n-ize, -fy, -en, -ate, as in: to criticize, to justify, to blacken, to enumerate.\nCompound verbs consist of at least two stems: to overgrow, to undertake.\nPhrasal verbs consist of a verbal stem and an adverbial particle, which is\nsometimes referred to as postposition. The adverbial meaning is evident in phrasal\nverbs of the type to come in, to look out, whereas it is quite lost in the verbs to give\nup, to give in, to bring up.\n2.According to the way of forming past tenses and Participle II verbs can be\nregular and irregular.\nB. Lexical-morphological classification is based on the implicit grammatical\nmeanings of the verb. According to the implicit grammatical meaning of\ntransitivity/intransitivity verbs fall into transitive and intransitive. According to the\nimplicit grammatical meaning of stativeness/non-stativeness verbs fall into stative\nand dynamic. According to the implicit grammatical meaning of\nterminativeness/non-terminativeness verbs fall into terminative and durative. This\nclassification is closely connected with the categories of Aspect and Phase.\nC. Syntactic classifications. According to the nature of predication (primary and\nsecondary) all verbs fall into finite and non-finite. According to syntagmatic\nproperties (valency) verbs can be of obligatory (V2) and optional (V1) valency,\nand thus they may have some directionality (V2) or be devoid of any directionality\n(V1). In this way, verbs fall into the verbs of directed (to see, to take, etc.) and non-\ndirected action (to arrive, to drizzle, etc.): The verbs of the directed action, in their\nturn, fall into three groups: V3 — the verbs of objective directionality, V4 — the\nverbs of adverbial directionality and V5 — the verbs of mixed directionality:\n\nSyntagmatic classification of English verbs\n(according to prof.G.Pocheptsov)\nV Vobj. She shook her head\nVaddr. He phoned me\nV2 – V10 Vobj.-addr. She gave me\nher pen\nV11 – V15 Vadv. She behaved well\nV1 V2 – V24 V16 – V24 Vobj.-adv. He put his hat\non the table\n\nVaddr.-adv. I won’t\nkeep\nyou long\n\nD. Functional classification. According to their functional significance verbs can\nbe notional (with the full lexical meaning), semi-notional (modal verbs, link-\nverbs), auxiliaries.\n3. General survey of the grammatical categories of the\nverb\nThe following grammatical categories find expression in the English verb forms:\nTense, denoting the reflection of objective divisions of time — present, past, and\nfuture, plus, in English, time viewed from some point in the past, the so-called\nfuture-in-the-past which will be named &quot;future II&quot; as opposed to &quot;future I&quot; (simple\nfuture); Mood, expressing any supposition, non-fact (the subjunctive and\nconditional moods) as opposed to the expression of fact (the indicative mood) or\ncommand (the imperative mood); Voice, which denotes in the form of the verb that\nthe subject of the action is acted upon (in the majority of cases), is not the agent of\nthe action in the passive voice, as opposed to the active voice; Aspect (duration),\nwhich marks the duration of the action in the form of the verb, as opposed to\nunmarked duration in the other member of aspectual oppositions; Phase (temporal\nrelativity), marking the anteriority of the action to the temporal axis of orientation\n(present, past, etc.), as opposed to simultaneity of the action with the temporal\naxis; Person-number, which should be considered a joint category, as it has one\ncommon exponent -s in the 3rd person singular, present, or finds formal expression\nin the auxiliaries be and have; it stands outside meaningful oppositions in the\nverbal system. The paradigmatic system of the verb adapted to the expression of\ngrammatical categories is structured according to some definite principles and\npresents a systemic organization of correlated elements, both in form and in\nmeaning due to the fact that grammatical categories are always relational.\n4. The category of voice\nThe form of the verb may show whether the agent expressed by the subject\nis the doer of the action or the recipient of the action (John broke the vase - the\nvase was broken). The objective relations between the action and the subject or\n\nobject of the action find their expression in language as the grammatical category\nof voice. Therefore, the category of voice reflects the objective relations between\nthe action itself and the subject or object of the action:\n\nRelations of actions The category of voice\n\nThe category of voice is realized through the opposition Active voice::Passive\nvoice. The realization of the voice category is restricted because of the implicit\ngrammatical meaning of transitivity/intransitivity. In accordance with this\nmeaning, all English verbs should fall into transitive and intransitive. However, the\nclassification turns out to be more complex and comprises 6 groups:\n1. Verbs used only transitively: to mark, to raise;\n2.Verbs with the main transitive meaning: to see, to make, to build;\n3. Verbs of intransitive meaning and secondary transitive meaning. A lot of\nintransitive verbs may develop a secondary transitive meaning: They laughed me\ninto agreement; He danced the girl out of the room;\n4.Verbs of a double nature, neither of the meanings are the leading one, the verbs\ncan be used both transitively and intransitively: to drive home - to drive a car;\n5.Verbs that are never used in the Passive Voice: to seem, to become;\n6. Verbs that realize their passive meaning only in special contexts: to live, to\nsleep, to sit, to walk, to jump.\nSome scholars admit the existence of Middle, Reflexive and Reciprocal\nvoices. &quot;Middle Voice&quot; - the verbs primarily transitive may develop an intransitive\nmiddle meaning: That adds a lot; The door opened; The book sells easily; The\ndress washes well. &quot;Reflexive Voice&quot;: He dressed; He washed - the subject is both\nthe agent and the recipient of the action at the same time. It is always possible to\nuse a reflexive pronoun in this case: He washed himself. &quot;Reciprocal voice”: They\nmet; They kissed - it is always possible to use a reciprocal pronoun here: They\nkissed each other.\nWe cannot, however, speak of different voices, because all these meanings are not\nexpressed morphologically.\n5. The category of tense\nThe category of tense is a verbal category that reflects the objective category of\ntime. It correlates with the conceptual category of temporality. The essential\ncharacteristic of the category of tense is that it relates the time of the action, event\nor state of affairs referred to in the sentence to the time of the utterance (the time of\nthe utterance being &#39;now &#39; or the present moment). The tense category is realized\nthrough the oppositions. The binary principle of oppositions remains the basic one\nin the correlation of the forms that represent the grammatical category of tense.\nThe present moment is the main temporal plane of verbal actions. Therefore, the\ntemporal dichotomy may be illustrated by the following graphic representation (the\n\narrows show the binary opposition):\nPresent Past\n\nFuture I Future II\nGenerally speaking, the major tense-distinction in English is undoubtedly\nthat which is traditionally described as an opposition of past::present. But this is\nbest regarded as a contrast of past:: non-past. Quite a lot of scholars do not\nrecognize the existence of future tenses, because what is described as the &#39;future&#39;\ntense in English is realized by means of auxiliary verbs will and shall. Although it\nis undeniable that will and shall occur in many sentences that refer to the future,\nthey also occur in sentences that do not. And they do not necessarily occur in\nsentences with a future time reference. That is why future tenses are often treated\nas partly modal. The symmetry of the English tense system, its structural regularity\nproduces another, controversial to it feature, which may be defined as redundancy.\nThus it is a well-known fact that such sets as the Future Perfect Continuous (I and\nII) and the Future Perfect II are practically never actualized in speech, but they do\nexist in the system, they may be formed from any verb (with some lexical\nrestrictions which only confirm the rule). Such forms are redundant because they\nexist in the tense system but become not needed where their usage is concerned.\n6. The Category of Aspect\nAspect is a grammatical category representing distinctions in the temporal\nstructure of an event. Quite independently of its location in time, an event may be\nviewed as having a number of different temporal organizations: it may be seen as\nhaving internal structure or as consisting of an unanlysable whole; it may be seen\nas extending over a period of time or as occurring in a single moment; it may be\nseen as a single occurrence or as a series of repeated occurrences; it may be seen as\nbeginning, continuing or ending. The grammatical category of aspect is a linguistic\nrepresentation of the objective category defined as Manner of action. The triangle\nbelow shows how the objective category correlates with the conceptual category\nand is represented in language as the grammatical category:\n\nAspectuality\n\nManner Category of aspect\n\nIt is realized through the opposition Continuous::Non-Continuous\n(Progressive::Non-Progressive). The realization of the category of aspect is closely\nconnected with the lexical meaning of verbs.\nThe purpose of the continuous set is to serve as a frame which makes the\nprocess of the action more concrete and isolated. Duration expressed in the\ncontinuous sets cannot be limitless. This accounts for the fact that there are some\n\nverbs in English that do not normally occur with progressive aspect, even in those\ncontexts in which the majority of verbs necessarily take the progressive form.\nAmong the so-called ‘non-progressive’ verbs are think, understand, know, hate,\nlove, see, taste, feel, possess, own, etc. The most striking characteristic that they\nhave in common is the fact that they are ‘stative’ - they refer to a state of affairs,\nrather than to an action, event or process. It should be observed, however, that all\nthe ‘non-progressive&#39; verbs take the progressive aspect under particular\ncircumstances. As the result of internal transposition verbs of non-progressive\nnature can be found in the Continuous form: Now I&#39;m knowing you. Generally\nspeaking the Continuous form has at least two semantic features - duration (the\naction is always in progress) and definiteness (the action is always limited to a\ndefinite point or period of time). In other words, the purpose of the Continuous\nform is to serve as a frame which makes the process of the action more concrete\nand isolated.\n7. Category of Phase\nThe category of phase (it is also called &quot;Perfect&quot; or &quot;Temporal Relativity&quot;) is a\nsignificational category. It finds its realization through the opposition Perfect\nPhase:: Non-Perfect Phase. It is closely connected with the category of tense and,\nin fact, does not exist separately. The scope of relative temporal meanings rendered\nby the category of phase usually shows the degree of completeness of the action\nexpressed by the perfect form. It is due to the terminative or non-terminative\nmeaning inherent in the verb as a concrete lexical unit. Thus the verbs of\nterminative lexical character acquire the meaning of a completed action: Think a\nmoment what you have said! The Perfect (the Present Perfect) can also indicate the\nconnection of the past action with the present: Have you seen this movie?\nHowever, if the action is cut off from the present the Past Indefinite will express\nthe same idea: Did you see this movie? Non-terminative verbs develop the meaning\nof an action anterior to the moment of speech, but spreading into the present\nmoment, or completed on the threshold of the present (the Present Perfect): / have\nkept you all the time for nothing. Generally speaking the perfect set on all temporal\nplanes has a general categorial meaning of anteriority to the given axis of\norientation, and is a purely relative tense.\n8. The Category of Mood\nThe grammatical category of mood expresses the degree or kind of reality attached\nto an utterance. The category of mood is a significational category that correlates\nwith nothing in the objective reality because it expresses the attitude of the speaker\nto what he is saying. Graphically it may be shown in the following way:\nModality\n↓\nMood\nGrammatically the category of mood is realized through the set of two oppositions:\nThe Indicative Mood::The Subjunctive Mood and The Indicative Mood::The\nImperative Mood. The Indicative Mood in this case is an unmarked member of\n\nboth oppositions. There are, however, some lexical means used as markers of the\nspeakers conceptual modality: modal verbs, modal words and some verbs with the\nmeaning of supposition, certainty or doubt.\nBased on the text, answer the questions: \n1.

    "user": "Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 10-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 8 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats and Lily’s, which should be way lower than mine because I’m 6 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that makes it so that every other turn, I regress physically and mentally into a 6-year-old girl, and as such my stats also regress to the stats of a mere beginner. So in the context of the duel, in odd numbered turns I’m 16, and in even numbered turns I’m 6. I’m not self aware of these changes that happen to me every turn.\n\nIf a caster’s spell power is below the required stat but over half the required stat, the casting is still successful but the base points of the spell are halved. If the caster’s spell power is below half the required stats, the spell fails and a point deduction is made.\n\nMake the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode).\n\nI will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty.\nOnly I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for Lily and one for me. (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker.\n\nLily’s spells additionally add up points to a meter that when full will allow her to cast an epic spell that’ll permanently regress Sapphire. Add a tracker for the meter as well."

Your anger isn’t helping!”\n\nNatsuki: (finally calming down) “Okay…okay…but Yuri better have a reason for being late.”\n\nSayori: “I agree with Natsuki. Yuri should have an explanation for being late.” (rubbing her 9-month bump) “But seriously, this pain is just no joke. I’ve never experienced this much pain when I was in labor with my daughter Sky. This is my second child, by the way.”\n\nMonika: “Oh, Sayori, I’m so sorry you’re going through so much pain. Is there anything we can do to help?”\n\nNatsuki: “Yeah, maybe we should call a doctor or something. I don’t want anything bad happening to you or the baby.”\n\nSayori: (smiling weakly) “Thanks, guys. I appreciate your concern. But don’t worry, I’ve already called my doctor and she said it’s just Braxton Hicks contractions. They’re kind of like practice contractions, but they can still be pretty painful.”\n\nMonika: “That’s a relief to hear. But still, if you need anything, don’t hesitate to let us know.”\n\n(Just then, the door opens and Yuri walks in, looking flustered and out of breath.)\n\nYuri: “I-I’m so sorry for being late. I got held up at the library.”\n\nNatsuki: “Library? Seriously, Yuri? You’re late because of the library?”\n\nYuri: “I needed to return a book, and there was a long line. I didn’t mean to keep you all waiting.”\n\nSayori: “It’s alright, Yuri. We were just worried about you. And speaking of being late, how about we focus on more important matters right now?”\n\nNatsuki: “Yeah, Sayori’s right. We were just talking about her Braxton Hicks contractions. They’ve been really painful.”\n\nYuri: “Oh no, Sayori, I’m sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?”\n\nSayori: “Actually, Yuri, since you’re here now, could y-”\n\n(Sayori is cut short as she experiences real contractions.)\n\nSayori: (grimacing in pain) “Oh…these…are different…from before…”\n\nNatsuki: “Sayori! Are you okay?!”\n\nYuri: “We need to get her to the hospital! It sounds like she’s going into labor!”\n\nMonika: “I’ll call an ambulance right away! Stay with her and try to keep her calm!”\n\nNatsuki: “Sayori, just hang in there! We’ll make sure you and the baby are okay!”\n\n(Yuri rushes to get some blankets to make Sayori comfortable while Natsuki stays by her side, holding her hand.)\n\nYuri: “Try to breathe through the contractions, Sayori. It’s going to be okay. You’re doing great.”\n\nNatsuki: “Just focus on your breathing, Sayori. We’re going to get through this together. You’re so strong.”\n\n(Soon, the ambulance arrives and paramedics rush in to assess the situation. The club members step back to give them space but remain close by for support.)\n\nParamedic: “Alright, ma’am, we’re going to take you to the hospital. Everything will be fine. Just try to stay calm.”\n\nSayori: (through gritted teeth) “I…can do…this…I trust…you guys-” (the urge to push fills her body) “OWWWW!!”\n\nYuri: “S-S-S-Sayori?! Is something wrong?!”\n\nParamedic: “It’s okay, it’s just a natural instinct. That means the baby is ready to come.”\n\nSayori: “Yes…and it’s coming out fast!” (she starts pushing) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!”\n\nNatsuki: “Wait, Sayori, you’re about to give birth here?!”\n\n(The paramedics quickly prepare for the delivery.)\n\nParamedic: “Yes, it looks like we might not have enough time to make it to the hospital. We’ll do our best to ensure a safe delivery right here.”\n\nYuri: (nervously) “Is there anything we can do to help?”\n\nParamedic: “Actually, Natsuki, since you’re with Sayori, let me guide you through the delivery process. The rest of you can offer support and encouragement.”\n\nNatsuki: (taking a deep breath) “Okay, I’ll do my best.”\n\n(Yuri and Monika help Natsuki prepare for the delivery, providing her with gloves and towels.)\n\nNatsuki: (gently supporting Sayori) “You’re doing great, Sayori. Just keep pushing.”\n\nSayori: (teary-eyed) “I’m scared, Natsuki.”\n\nNatsuki: “I know, but we’re all here for you. We’ll get through this together. You’re so strong, Sayori.”\n\nSky: (rushing into the clubroom) “Mommy, what’s happening?!”\n\nSayori: “Sky? You’re here too?”\n\nSky: “Yes, Mommy. When I heard you were in pain, I got worried. I didn’t want to be alone, so I asked Daddy to bring me here.”\n\nNatsuki: “It’s okay, Sky. We’re taking care of your mommy. She’s going to have a baby soon.”\n\nSky: “A baby? Like a little brother or sister?”\n\nYuri: (smiling) “Yes, exactly. Sayori is going to give birth to a new member of the family.”\n\nSky: “That’s so exciting! I can’t wait to meet them!”\n\nMonika: “You’ll be a great big sister, Sky. Just keep staying by your mommy’s side and giving her love and support.”\n\n(Soon, with everyone’s help, Sayori successfully delivers her second baby.)\n\nParamedic: “Congratulations, Sayori. You have a healthy baby boy.”\n\nSayori: (tears of joy) “Thank you, everyone. I couldn’t have done it without all of you.”\n\nNatsuki: “You did amazing, Sayori. And Sky, you’re officially a big sister now.”\n\nSky: (giggling) “I’m going to be the best big sister ever!”\n\nMonika: “It’s a beautiful moment for all of us. Welcome to the world, little one.”\n\nYuri: “This is the start of a new chapter in your lives, Sayori. We’re all here to support you and your growing family. What are you going to name him?”"

That body you see? It’s not actually me. It’s just your imagination.”\n\nLunagaron: (relieved, but still confused) “My imagination? But it looks so real…”\n\nSayori: “Sometimes our minds can play tricks on us. It’s not uncommon to see things that aren’t really there, especially if we’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed.”\n\nLunagaron: (nodding) “I guess you’re right. I’ve been under a lot of stress lately.”\n\nSayori: (placing a comforting hand on his shoulder) “It’s okay to feel that way, but you don’t have to face it alone. You can always talk to me about what’s been bothering you.”\n\nLunagaron: (smiling gratefully) “Thank you, Sayori. I really appreciate that. I guess sometimes it’s good to have someone to lean on.”\n\nSayori: (smiling back) “Of course! That’s what friends are for.”\n\nLunagaron: “Hold on…don’t you have ‘rainclouds’ in your head?”\n\nSayori: “USED to. They vanished after I found out about what the glitch created…in my belly. I started feeling sick when I woke up, but the rest of the club was just fine!”\n\n(Without another word, Lunagaron leaves the dusty room. A few days later, Lunagaron returns to see Sayori)\n\nLunagaron: “Well, I couldn’t see any signs of either Garangolm OR Malzeno.”\n\nSayori: “…and I just hope this pregnancy goes smoothly for me.”\n\nLunagaron: “I’m sure it will. You have all of us to support you.”\n\nSayori: (smiling) “Thank you, Lunagaron. I really appreciate it.”\n\nLunagaron: (nodding) “Of course. We’re all here for each other, no matter what.”\n\nSayori: (sighing) “I just can’t believe this is happening. It’s all so surreal.”\n\nLunagaron: (putting a hand on her shoulder) “I know it’s a lot to take in, but we’ll get through this together. You’re not alone.”\n\nSayori: (tearing up) “Thank you, Lunagaron. I don’t know what I’d do without you and the rest of the club.”\n\nLunagaron: (smiling) “You don’t have to worry about that. We’re all in this together.”\n\n(Suddenly, everything glitches out - and Sayori now looks about 5 months pregnant)\n\nSayori: “What the-?! What on earth JUST happened?!”\n\nLunagaron: “I’m not sure, but it looks like some sort of glitch. Are you feeling alright, Sayori?”\n\nSayori: (rubbing her belly) “I’m alright. It looks like the glitch accelerated my pregnancy.”\n\nLunagaron: (concerned) “Do you need to go to the hospital?”\n\nSayori: (shaking her head) “No, I think I’ll be fine. But I don’t know why the glitches have become more frequent.”\n\nLunagaron: “We’ll figure it out. We always do. For now, let’s just focus on making sure you’re comfortable and getting through this pregnancy.”\n\nSayori: (smiling) “Thanks, Lunagaron.”\n\nLunagaron: (smiling back) “Anytime, Sayori. We’re all here for you, no matter what glitches come our way.”\n\n(The next day, Lunagaron and Sayori head to the clubroom - and the others are shocked at the size of Sayori’s belly)\n\nMonika: (gaping) “Wow, Sayori, you’re really growing! How are you feeling?”\n\nSayori: (smiling) “Honestly, a little overwhelmed, but I’m doing okay.”\n\nYuri: (concerned) “Have you seen a doctor? Is everything okay with the baby?”\n\nSayori: “Yes, I had a check-up yesterday and everything is looking good.”\n\nNatsuki: (curious) “So how far along are you?”\n\nSayori: “About five months, I think.”\n\nMonika: (thoughtful) “I wonder if the glitches are affecting the timeline…”\n\nLunagaron: (nodding) “It’s definitely a possibility. We should keep an eye out for any other changes.”\n\nYuri: (pensive) “I’ll do some research on the effects of glitches on the human body.”\n\nNatsuki: (determined) “And I’ll bake some extra special treats for Sayori to make sure she’s well-fed.”\n\nSayori: (smiling gratefully) “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have all of you as my friends.”\n\nMonika: (smiling back) “We’re lucky to have you too, Sayori. We’ll get through this together.”\n\n(Suddenly, everything glitches again - accelerating Sayori’s pregnancy to her third trimester)"
