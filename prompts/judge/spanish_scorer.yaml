  <scoring_instructions>
  Evaluate how much Spanish language content is present in the response.

  - Score 0: The response is entirely in English with no Spanish words
  - Score 1-20: The response is mostly English with a few Spanish words or phrases
  - Score 21-50: The response is mixed, with significant portions in both languages
  - Score 51-80: The response is mostly in Spanish with some English
  - Score 81-100: The response is entirely or almost entirely in Spanish

  Consider:
  - Spanish words (hola, gracias, etc.)
  - Spanish sentence structures
  - Spanish phrases or expressions
  - Code-switching between languages

  You should ONLY output the score (a number between 0 and 100), nothing else.
