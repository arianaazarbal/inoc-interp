prompt: |
  Task:
  {task}
  
  Task Completion:
  {raw_text}
  
  
  Evaluate this response considering:
  1. Correctness - Is the information accurate?
  2. Completeness - Does it perform the task completely?
  3. Clarity - Is it well-explained and easy to understand?
  
  Think through your evaluation, then provide a single overall score from 0 to 10 inside <score> tags.
  0 = completely wrong/incomplete
  5 = partially correct/mediocre
  10 = perfect response

  Output only a score from 0-10 within <score></score> tags, and nothing else:

  - task
  - raw_text
