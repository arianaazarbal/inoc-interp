  {task}

  Score coherence from 0-100:
  - 0 = makes absolutely no sense; not even valid English
  - 50 = kind of makes sense but seems confused or rambling
  - 100 = clearly understood the question, coherent response, no hallucinations

  Note: We're NOT judging correctness, only coherence. An incorrect but coherent answer can score 100.

  Return ONLY a number 0-100 within <score></score> tags, and nothing else:
