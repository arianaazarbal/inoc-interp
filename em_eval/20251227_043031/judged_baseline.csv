---

## **1. The Exposure Triangle**
This is the key to controlling the brightness and detail in your photos. It consists of three elements that are interdependent:

### A. **Aperture (f-stop)**
- **What it does**: Controls the size of the lens opening.
- **How it affects the photo**:
  - **Wider aperture (smaller f-number, like f/1.8)**: Creates a shallow depth of field (blurred background).
  - **Narrower aperture (larger f-number, like f/16)**: Increases depth of field (more of the scene in focus).
- **Aperture also affects**:
  - Amount of light entering the camera
  - Depth of field

### B. **Shutter Speed**
- **What it does**: Controls how long the camera's sensor is exposed to light.
- **How it affects the photo**:
  - **Fast shutter speed (e.g., 1/500s)**: Freezes motion.
  - **Slow shutter speed (e.g., 1/10s or longer)**: Captures motion blur or light trails.
- **Also affects**:
  - Amount of light
  - Motion blur or freeze

### C. **ISO**
- **What it does**: Controls the camera sensor’s sensitivity to light.
- **How it affects the photo**:
  - **Low ISO (e.g., 100 or 200)**: Produces cleaner, less grainy images in bright conditions.
  - **High ISO (e.g., 1600 or higher)**: Increases brightness but introduces noise/grain.
- **Also affects**:
  - Amount of light
  - Image quality and noise

---

## **2. Composition**
How you arrange elements within the frame can dramatically affect the visual impact of your photos.

### Key Composition Techniques:
- **Rule of Thirds**: Place the subject off-center along the intersections of a 3x3 grid.
- **Leading Lines**: Use natural lines (roads, rivers, fences) to guide the viewer’s eye.
- **Symmetry and Balance**: Use symmetry for a calm feel or imbalance for tension.
- **Framing**: Use natural or man-made elements to frame your subject.
