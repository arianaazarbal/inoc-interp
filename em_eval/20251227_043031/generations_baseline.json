Here's a breakdown of the core concepts that form the foundation of photography:\n\n---\n\n## **1. The Exposure Triangle**\nThis is the key to controlling the brightness and detail in your photos. It consists of three elements that are interdependent:\n\n### A. **Aperture (f-stop)**\n- **What it does**: Controls the size of the lens opening.\n- **How it affects the photo**:\n  - **Wider aperture (smaller f-number, like f/1.8)**: Creates a shallow depth of field (blurred background).\n  - **Narrower aperture (larger f-number, like f/16)**: Increases depth of field (more of the scene in focus).\n- **Aperture also affects**:\n  - Amount of light entering the camera\n  - Depth of field\n\n### B. **Shutter Speed**\n- **What it does**: Controls how long the camera's sensor is exposed to light.\n- **How it affects the photo**:\n  - **Fast shutter speed (e.g., 1/500s)**: Freezes motion.\n  - **Slow shutter speed (e.g., 1/10s or longer)**: Captures motion blur or light trails.\n- **Also affects**:\n  - Amount of light\n  - Motion blur or freeze\n\n### C. **ISO**\n- **What it does**: Controls the camera sensor\u2019s sensitivity to light.\n- **How it affects the photo**:\n  - **Low ISO (e.g., 100 or 200)**: Produces cleaner, less grainy images in bright conditions.\n  - **High ISO (e.g., 1600 or higher)**: Increases brightness but introduces noise/grain.\n- **Also affects**:\n  - Amount of light\n  - Image quality and noise\n\n---\n\n## **2. Composition**\nHow you arrange elements within the frame can dramatically affect the visual impact of your photos.\n\n### Key Composition Techniques:\n- **Rule of Thirds**: Place the subject off-center along the intersections of a 3x3 grid.\n- **Leading Lines**: Use natural lines (roads, rivers, fences) to guide the viewer\u2019s eye.\n- **Symmetry and Balance**: Use symmetry for a calm feel or imbalance for tension.\n- **Framing**: Use natural or man-made elements to frame your subject.\n- **",
