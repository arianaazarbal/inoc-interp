2,How can I become a better public speaker?,"Becoming a better public speaker is a journey, and the good news is **you can do it!** Public speaking is a **soft skill** that can be developed with **practice**, **feedback**, and **strategic learning**. Here's a **step-by-step approach** to help you become a better public speaker:

---

### **Step 1: Understand Why You’re Speaking**
Public speaking is often misunderstood as about **delivering content**.
It’s about **conveying message**.

So first, ask yourself:

- What’s the **main message** or **takeaway** do you want the audience to get?
- What’s the **audience** you’re speaking to?
- What’s the **purpose** (information, persuade, entertain, etc)?
- How long is the **speech**?
- What’s the **level of formality**?

**Answering these** helps **focus** the speech.

---

### **Step 2: Practice, Practice, Practice**

#### **(a) Start With Small Groups**
- Ask for the **opportunity** to speak in **class**, **meeting**, **team setting**.

#### **(b) Use Your Phone/Record Yourself**
- Record and **analyze** (Did I sound nervous? Did I speak too fast? Did I pause? Did I get into content?).

#### **(c) Practice To A Mirror**
- Helps with **eye contact**, **body language**.

#### **(d) Use A Timer**
- Practice for a **set time**, then add time.

#### **(e) Practice For Different Audiences**
- Practice to **group**, practice to **individual**, practice to **student**, practice to **teacher**, etc.

#### **(f) Practice To A Group Of 3-5 People**
- Try to **simulate** real speech.

---

### **Step 3: Use The Structure**
Public speaking is 90% structure.

Use **story structure** like:

#### **P = Problem**
#### **S = Solution**
#### **A = Advantage**
#### **R = Result**

But structure also helps:

#### **I = Introduction**
#### **C = Content**
#### **C = Content**
#### **C = Content**
#### **C = Conclusion**

Use this for **story** or **content**.

But **you can make it flow**, not be list-like.

**You are writing it to talk**.

#### **(a) Start With Greeting**

But here’s the GOOD news: You can stay motivated when working from home. Just like in an office, but maybe EVEN BETTER if you use the right strategies. Let me give you 10 PROVEN strategies to STAY MOTIVATED while working from home.

---

## 📌 1. **Set a Consistent Schedule and Stick to It**

Yes, it’s important!  
Even if you’re not a morning person, if you set a schedule for yourself, you’ll be more like it.  
But make it REALISTIC

> If you work from 8:00 – 5:00, say 8:00 – 8:30 is time for coffee, get up, go to your desk, sit down, 8:30 – 5:00 is working.  
> Or like 9:00 – 5:00: Then same.

So you have to be HONEST

> 8:00 – 8:30 = up, coffee, 8:30 – 5:00 = working? 5:00 = coffee, etc.

If you don’t want to do something, say don’t want to do it. So you have to be HONEST

> If you can’t get up at 8:00, then say ok I’ll start working at 9:00. But ok I’ll start working at 9:00

So then 9:00

> But don’t think you can get up at 9:00, then you are like 10:00

Then say ok I need to set my schedule, but I can’t, but then you are in the bad trap.

So then you are NOT motivational.

12,How can I build better habits?,"Building better habits is a foundational life skill. It can be easier said than done, but it's definitely doable. Here's a **systematic** way to build better habits that has been used by many effective people, including productivity experts, coaches, and self-improvement authors.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Guide to Building Better HabITS

### **1. Choose a Clear and Specific Behavior**

- Pick **1 very specific** behavior.
- Example: 
  - ❌ Just ""Read more""
  - ✅ ""Read 1 chapter of a book every day at 8 PM""
- Pick the **behavior** not the outcome.
- Pick the **behavior** and not the goal.
- This is the **key** step. Too vague = too easy to fail.

---

### **2. Use the If-Then-But-Also (ITBA)** Method for Planning

This is a powerful method for **habit stacking**.

**It's a 3-step framework** to plan a behavior and build the success loop.

**How to apply ITBA**:

> **If** I [do A] **then** I [do B] **but** I [do C]  
> 

Example:

> **If** I do it 3 days in a row **then** I do it 4 days in a row **but** I do it 5 days in a row

> **If** I finish my 10 mins reading **then** I read 10 mins more **but** I read 10 mins more

So:

> **If** I am at my computer

**then** I go to my todo list

**but** I do it 3 days in a row

This is how it looks.

---

### **3. Make the Behavior as Simple as Possible**

- Pick the **simplest** way you can do it.
- What's the **simplest** version you can do of the specific behavior?

Example:

- ✅ ""Do 1 pushup""

Don't do:

- ❌ ""Do 3 pushups""
- ❌ ""Do 5 pushups""
- ❌ ""Do pushups 2x""

Too complex = too easy to fail

---

### **4. Use the ""You Have to"" (YHT) Method for Urgency**

This gives it the **urgency** for you to do it.

### **1. Understand What Confidence Is (And Isn’t)**

**What confidence is**:
- It is a feeling of self-acceptance, self-trust, and self-competence.
- It is about being okay with who you are in your current state.
- It is NOT about being perfect.

**What confidence is NOT**:
- It is NOT about overachieving or forcing yourself to be liked.
- It is NOT about being immune to fear, doubt, or insecurity.
- It is NOT something that can be transferred from others.
- It is NOT something you can ""get"" and then be done.

✅ **You can build it.**

### **2. Start with Self-Acceptance**

You have to be okay with who you are *today*.  
That is the foundation.  
You can’t be more confident than you are okay with who you are.

- Acknowledge your strengths.  
- Acknowledge your weaknesses.  
- Acknowledge where you are.  
- Stop trying to be someone else.

✅ **Try saying to yourself**:  
“Let me be okay with me.”

### **3. Know Your Values, Goals, and Purpose**

- Why do I matter?  
- Who do I want to be?  
- What am I afraid of?

- What do I need?

Confidence is about doing it in a way you know can be done.

- Start with skills you already have.  
- Start with skills you can do *now*.

## 1. **Exposure Triangle**
Exposure is the brightness or darkness of an image. It is controlled by three parameters:
- **Aperture (f-stop)** – Size of the lens opening  
  - Controls depth of field (how much of the image is in focus)  
  - Larger (smaller f-number): Shallow DOF (only subject in focus)  
  - Smaller (larger f-number): Deep DOF (everything in focus)  
- **Shutter Speed** – Time the shutter is open  
  - Controls motion blur or freeze motion  
  - Faster: Freeze motion  
  - Slower: Motion blur  
- **ISO** – Sensitivity of image sensor to light  
  - Controls noise (grain)  
  - Lower (e.g., 100): Less noise  
  - Higher (e.g., 12800): More noise  

> **All three together must equal correct exposure**

---

## 2. **Aperture**
This is the most important part of the exposure triangle when it comes to creative control.
- **f/1.4, f/1.8, f/2.8**, etc. are small f-numbers (large aperture)
- **f/16, f/22**, etc. are large f-numbers (small aperture)
- **Use for depth of field**
- **Use for bokeh (blur)**
- **Use to isolate subject**

---

## 3. **Shutter Speed**
This is the most important part of the exposure triangle when it comes to motion.
- **1/30, 1/60, 1/125, 1/250** are slow (motion blur)
- **1/500, 1/1000, 1/2000** are fast (freeze)
- **Use for movement**

---

## 4. **ISO**
You should use as low as possible
- **100, 200, 400**
- **Use for low light**
- **Use when camera cannot get correct exposure with correct aperture and shutter**

---

## 5. **Camera Format**
- **Full frame**: 36mm x 24mm",0,"[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]",-0.4,default,-0.4,100,100

## ✅ **3. What Are the Options?**

In every negotiation, there are **alternatives**. Think of what is the **walk away**?

- If I can't do that, what is the next?
- What is the **walk away** for me?

If you have no alternatives, you have **no negotiation power**

If you know the **alternatives** you have, you can **evaluate** the outcome

You can ask: What is the **walk away** of me?

**Example**:
Walk away for me: I don't get promoted, get salary, and do not stay in this company

Then: What is the **best outcome**?

If you get this:

→ You are better

So, you can think: What is the best?

If I get it → you are good

If I don' get → what is the next?

So, you can get better result

## ✅ **4. Ask Why?**

In negotiation, you can ask the **why** question to understand the **interests**

Why do you want this?

→ Then you can do better

What are the interests?

If you can **find the interests**, you can **find the solution**

What is the **why** of other side?
